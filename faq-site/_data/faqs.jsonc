Symptoms may start 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4°F or greater)\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Chills\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\n**Not everyone with COVID-19 has a fever. Even mild symptoms** (like a headache or dry cough) could be signs of COVID-19.\n\n**Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms**. People with COVID-19 who don't have any symptoms can spread the virus to other people. Learn [how to protect yourself and others](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others).\n\n**If you have symptoms, even mild ones, contact your health care provider to get tested**. Your provider will test you at their office or refer you for testing nearby. Stay home while waiting for your result.\n\n**If you do not have a health care provider**, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\n**Get medical care immediately** if you have trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or changes in color on your lips, gums, face, around the eyes, or nails.\n\nLearn more about what to do [if you have COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/if-you-have-covid-19).\n\nFind information about the [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) from the CDC.",

Children, like adults, who have COVID-19 but have no symptoms can still spread the virus to others.\n\nMost children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or have no symptoms at all. However, some children can get severely ill from COVID-19. They might require hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe. In rare cases, they might die. Babies under 1 year old and children with certain underlying conditions may be more likely to have severe illness from COVID-19. Learn more from the CDC about [COVID-19 in children and teens](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/symptoms.html).\n\nA few children have developed [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/). Currently, information about MIS-C is limited, and the CDC is working to learn more.\n\nYou can find information about cases across age groups along with other COVID-19 data on the [Vermont Dashboard](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/vermont-dashboard).

            "answer": "**Are face masks or coverings required in Vermont? Is there a mask mandate?**\n\nRequirements have changed effective May 14, 2021. However, it is important to remember that people with COVID-19 can spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. **Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you** from getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\n**If You Are Fully Vaccinated**\n\nAnyone who is fully vaccinated is not required to wear a mask or maintain a 6-foot distance from others. You are fully vaccinated 14 days after your final shot.\n\nThere are some exceptions, and you will need to wear a mask in schools, health care settings, long-term care facilities, correctional facilities and on public transportation. Businesses or municipalities can also require you to wear a mask if they choose to do so.\n\n**If You Are Unvaccinated or Partially Vaccinated (including children)**\n\nThese individuals must follow the current mask requirements:\n\n**1. INDOORS: You are required to wear a face mask or covering in indoor public spaces in Vermont.** Indoor public spaces include businesses, public buildings, and group living settings (such as long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nIn indoor **private settings**, we recommend that you wear a mask anytime people who are not fully vaccinated get together (for example, at a gathering with family and friends or riding in a car). Check the current [limits on gatherings and events](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\n**2. OUTDOORS: When you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you can’t maintain a 6-foot distance.**\n\nVermonters can decide whether they need a mask by considering three elements:\n\n*   Outside\n*   Masked\n*   Distanced\n\nYou need two of these three elements. For example – if you’re outside and distanced, you don’t need a mask. If you’re outside and not distanced, wear a mask. And if you’re not outside, you should wear a mask and keep a distance.\n\nMasks are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also **not required for** – and should not be worn by:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance\n*   Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask\n\n**If you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing**, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.\n\nBusinesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).\n\nThe CDC requires everyone to [wear masks when using public transportation](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html).\n\nIn addition to wearing masks, continue to follow the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) like keeping 6 feet apart and washing your hands often.\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [CDC’s guide to masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) – how to choose, wear, store and wash masks\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of **free cloth masks** to the public.

You can make an appointment or just walk in. Testing is free to all, and many sites now let you [take your own sample](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/what-expect) using a short swab in your nose.\n\n[**Find out where to get tested**](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/where-get-tested).\n\nAnyone can get tested at a Health Department testing site if they do not have symptoms. This includes children 12 months or older, people who work in Vermont, visitors to Vermont and international travelers. Infants under 12 months can get tested at their health care provider’s office. Anyone under 18 should be accompanied by a parent or guardian or bring a signed parental consent form.\n\nThe Health Department uses and recommends [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671). You can get other tests, like at-home or saliva tests. However, if you are testing out of quarantine early, the test must be for a current infection (like a PCR test), except it cannot be an antigen test (also known as a rapid test).\n\nIf you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), **do not go to a testing site**. Talk to your health care provider about getting tested.\n\nIf you or your child don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/). If you are visiting Vermont or are an international traveler, you will need to contact your primary care provider or call Vermont 2-1-1 if you do not have a provider.\n\nThe Health Department recommends testing **as soon as possible** when:\n\n*   You have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms) (call your health care provider first).\n*   You are referred by your health care provider.\n*   You are not fully vaccinated and a person in your workplace or household, or a person you attended an event with, tests positive for COVID-19.\n\nYou may come to a Health Department testing site to get **tested more than once** if you have reason to be concerned about infection.\n\nIf you need a **ride to the testing site**, schedule your appointment first, and then call 833-387-7200 at least two days before the appointment.\n\n**Find out:**\n\n*   [Where to get tested and how to **schedule an appointment**](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/where-get-tested)\n*   [**What to expect** at a Health Department testing site](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/what-expect) – including answers to **more questions about testing**\n*   [What to do **while you’re waiting** for test results](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Waiting-For-Test-Results-English.pdf)\n*   [When you will get your **test results**](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4547)\n*   [What the different **types of tests** are](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#testing-types-of-tests)\n*   [How many Vermonters have been tested](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/vermont-dashboard) – this information is updated daily.",

The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out [what you need to do if you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\n**If you are** _**not**_ **identified as a close contact**, then you will not be called. While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and [get tested on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) or after if you have not had any symptoms. Learn more about [quarantine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4618).\n\nIf you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to follow the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

Even mild symptoms (like a headache or dry cough) could be signs of COVID-19. You can also check your symptoms on this [chart of COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community/schools-childcare/COVID19-symptoms-tablegraphic-v1.pdf) or with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).\n\nIf you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nIf you or a family member are sick, follow these steps to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and your community:\n\n*   Stay home except to get medical care. If you need to get medical care, call ahead before visiting your doctor.\n*   Separate yourself from other people and pets.\n*   Monitor your symptoms.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re around people and pets.\n*   Cover your coughs and sneezes with your sleeve or a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n*   Wash your hands often. Use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water aren't available.\n*   Avoid sharing personal household items.\n*   Clean all high-touch surfaces in your home daily.\n\nFind information from the CDC about [what to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html) and the [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm).\n\nFind out [what to do if you test positive for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-diagnosed-with-COVID-19_final.pdf).",

The infectious period starts two days before any symptoms began – or for people with COVID-19 who don't have symptoms, two days before they got tested – and continues [until they are recovered](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nClose contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a short period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**\n\n*   You live in the same home.\n*   You are intimate partners.\n*   You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.\n*   You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** _**not**_ **close contacts:**\n\n*   You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n*   You were their server at a restaurant.\n*   You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n*   You were in front of the person in line at the store.\n*   You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact**, you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

What do I need to know, and how can I help keep my children safe from COVID-19?**\n\n**Vaccination**\n\nSince children under age 12 cannot get vaccinated at this time, they are considered unvaccinated.\n\nVermont is now vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds, following the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in this age group. Learn more about [vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccines-vermont#vaccinesforchildren).\n\nLearn more about [why younger children can’t get vaccinated yet](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4804), and [how to make an appointment for 12 to 17-year-olds](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4849).\n\n**Testing**\n\nChildren 12 months or older can get tested at a Health Department testing site if they do not have symptoms. Infants under 12 months can get tested at their health care provider’s office. Anyone under 18 should be accompanied by a parent or guardian or bring a signed parental consent form. Learn more about [getting tested for COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4545).\n\nIf your child has [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), **do not go to a testing site**. Talk to their health care provider about getting tested. If your child doesn't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\n**Social Gatherings**\n\nFind out the [current limits on gatherings and events](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\nWhen gathering with other households, it’s safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19.\n\nWhen you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you can’t maintain a 6-foot distance, whether you are vaccinated or not.\n\n**Parental Shared Custody**\n\nWe encourage you to choose the form of travel with the lowest risk when you can, which is your personal vehicle. The CDC requires everyone to [wear masks when using public transportation](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html).\n\nChildren in shared custody that are in isolation because they have tested positive for COVD-19, or are in quarantine because they were identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, may isolate or quarantine in either household. It does not affect the shared custody schedule. However, this means that members of the household where the child is staying may need to quarantine. If the [child is in isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4764), household members will be required to quarantine. If the [child is in quarantine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4765), household members would not need to also quarantine, unless the child tests positive for COVID-19.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk.

Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you from getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThere are several [types of masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) to choose from, including cloth, disposable, N95 and KN95.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the most effective fabrics for **cloth masks** are:\n\n*   tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton and cotton blends\n*   breathable\n*   two or three fabric layers\n\nIf you choose to wear a gaiter as a face covering, fold it over so it is two layers.\n\nYou can also wear a **disposable mask**, like a surgical or medical procedure mask, instead of a cloth mask, now that they are in greater supply. These masks may provide some additional protection.\n\nThe CDC has found that “double masking” or **wearing two masks** (disposable mask underneath **and** a cloth mask on top) can offer a better fit and provide extra protection.\n\nTypically **N95** masks should be reserved for health care workers who are at highest risk and need them most. **KN95** masks are also available for the public to purchase, but make sure the mask has been [approved by the Food & Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas).\n\nWhichever mask you choose, **it is important to make sure it fits properly**. Learn more from the CDC about [improving how your mask protects you](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html).\n\nThe CDC continues to study the effectiveness of different types of masks, and we will update our recommendations as new scientific evidence becomes available.",

            "answer": "**What is quarantine?**\n\nQuarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from other people. This helps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before a person knows they are sick, or if they are infected with the virus and don’t have symptoms.\n\nQuarantine is for people who were in [close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4575) with someone with COVID-19 ([unless you are fully vaccinated](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4825) or [recently had COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4820)). Day 1 of your quarantine starts the day after you were last in contact with them.\n\n**Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days**. This means you can’t do any activities outside of your home, like going to school, work, or out to do errands. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms. Call your health care provider if you start to feel sick. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nYou are allowed to go outside for a walk or a bike ride while you are in quarantine only if:\n\n*   you do not have any symptoms,\n*   you are alone,\n*   you wear a mask at all times,\n*   you are in an uncrowded place, **and**\n*   you can stay at least 6 feet from other people at all times.\n\nFor example, you can go for a walk or bike ride in your neighborhood. You should not go for a walk or bike ride on a bike path, on busy hiking or biking trails, or in a downtown area.\n\n**You can end quarantine early** if you get tested on or after day 7 of your quarantine and get a negative test result. You must not have had any symptoms of COVID-19, and must continue to monitor yourself for symptoms for the full 14 days.

The testing measures the body’s immune response to the virus. It does not detect the virus itself.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nThe CDC is working with commercial laboratories to [estimate the percentage of people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) who were infected with the COVID-19 virus.

It’s also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.\n\n**If you test positive for COVID-19**, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out [what you need to do if you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\n**It’s important to answer the call** and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus. Governor Scott’s [Executive Order](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%208%20TO%20AMENDED%20AND%20RESTATED%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) calls on Vermonters to comply with all contact tracing requests.\n\nAll restaurants and other businesses are keeping a 30-day log of employee and guest names and contact information in case contact tracing is needed.\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nCurrently, Vermont is not participating in the contact tracing notifications that are available on some cell phones. We are waiting to see how successful this service is in other states who are participating. If it’s proven to be effective, we will consider using it.\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus. \n\nHowever, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth.\n\n**Make sure your face shield fits properly**. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece. Clean them regularly – especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield – and [handle them like masks](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4723) when putting them on or removing them.\n\n**People who have trouble breathing** can wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom, or a face shield. \n\n**Outdoor workers** who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a mask when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people).

Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you from getting or spreading COVID-19. Check Vermont’s current [mask requirements](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4540).\n\nA mask must be worn properly to be effective and avoid spreading the virus:\n\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting it on.\n*   Put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.\n*   Make sure it fits snugly against the side of your face.\n*   Slip the loops over your ears or tie the strings behind your head.\n*   Do not touch it when you are wearing it.\n*   Remove it by handling only the ear loops or ties and fold the outside corners together.\n*   Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately after removing it.\n\nWash your mask regularly and make sure it’s completely dry before using it again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate them for washing and have enough clean ones to wear.\n\n**During hot weather**, if you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot, take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.\n\n**During cold weather**, change your mask when it becomes wet. Keep a spare mask to replace the wet one, and put the wet one in a plastic bag until you get home. If you need to wear a scarf, ski mask or balaclava, wear it over your mask. If you wear glasses, find a mask that fits closely over your nose or has a nose wire to help reduce fogging.\n\nWearing masks is one way we can help slow the spread of COVID-19 – in addition to staying at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with and other [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [CDC’s guide to masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) – how to choose, wear, store and wash masks\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth masks to the public.

Employers can keep employees safe by following [universal guidance](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/vermont-forward/business-operations#universal-guidance) in their workplace.\n\nYou can end quarantine early if you get tested on or after day 7 of your quarantine and get a negative test result. You must not have had any symptoms of COVID-19, and must continue to monitor yourself for symptoms for the full 14 days. Find out more about [the option to end your quarantine early](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692).\n\nThe Health Department does **not** issue letters for employees to return to work.\n\nEmployers should not require a negative test before an employee who had COVID-19 can return to work, because studies show that someone may continue to test positive long after they have recovered and are no longer contagious. Once someone meets the [criteria for ending isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601), there is no longer a risk of them spreading the virus to others.\n\nThe best way to know when it’s safe for someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to return to work is to follow the guidance based on the presence of symptoms, or the amount of time that has passed since the person was tested.

People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom.\n\n**Make sure your face shield fits properly**. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

            "answer": "**How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?**\n\nBecause of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\n\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you don’t live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\n*   **How big the space is** – Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\n*   **How many people are in the room or area** – A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\n*   **How much ventilation there is** – Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. Using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\n*   **How humid the room or area is** - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you run a dehumidifier, follow all the manufacturer’s instructions to prevent problems, like mold.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nFollow the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [COVID-19 and indoor air](https://youtu.be/-0_zafaEUEM)\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Improving ventilation in your home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/Improving-Ventilation-Home.html) from the CDC\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC",

You are fully vaccinated 14 days after your final shot. Since children under age 12 cannot get vaccinated at this time, they are considered unvaccinated.\n\nAs of May 14, the following limits apply to gatherings in both public and private settings (for example, an event at a venue or a gathering at a home). If you don’t know if someone is fully vaccinated, then assume everyone is unvaccinated and follow that guidance. Find out [when the limits will change again](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/vermont-forward/events-and-gatherings).\n\n**For indoor gatherings**:\n\nThere can be one unvaccinated person per 50 square feet up to 300 unvaccinated people (whichever is less), plus any number of fully vaccinated people.\n\n**For outdoor gatherings:**\n\nThere can be 900 unvaccinated people, plus any number of fully vaccinated people.\n\n**If you are a visitor traveling to Vermont** and staying at a lodging establishment, short-term rental, or with friends and family, you must follow the gathering limits. Staying with another household is considered a social gathering and you must follow the rules listed above.\n\nCheck the current [mask requirements](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4540).\n\n**Find tips from the CDC:**\n\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html) \n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings)\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event)",

In situations where you have COVID-19 (for example, you’re a parent) and you **cannot** avoid close contact with those you take care of (for example, your children), then the people you take care of should quarantine while you are sick. They should also quarantine for 14 days after you are able to end [home isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nQuarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from other people. Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days since the day you were potentially exposed. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms. Learn about the [option to be tested](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) to end quarantine after 7 days.\n\nHowever, people who are [fully vaccinated](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4825) or who [recently had COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4820) do not need to quarantine.\n\nLearn more about when a child’s [parent or caregiver is sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/parents-caregivers.html) and find tips on what to do [when a household member is sick with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_Prevention-Extended-Families-English.pdf).",

Will the Health Department call me?**\n\nPlease **do not show up at state-run vaccine clinics to wait for extra doses**. These clinics include those run by the Health Department, the National Guard, health care partners, Costco, Hannaford, Price Chopper, Rite Aid, Shaws and Walmart. There are enough appointments for everyone. Generally, appointments are required, although some clinics may be able to accept walk-ins. When that happens, we will share that information on [our website](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine) and on our [@healthvermont social media channels](https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/social).\n\nTo help make sure we do not waste vaccine doses, state-run clinics make an estimate of how many doses may remain at the end of the day. If there is a possibility that there will be extra doses, then clinic staff will estimate how many may be available and call people who are currently scheduled for a future COVID-19 vaccine appointment to come in. We can’t guarantee that you will get the vaccine earlier if you are called because the estimated number of available doses could change.\n\nThe Health Department will reach out to you if there is a certain clinic that needs people for a standby list. **Please do not call the Health Department to be put on the standby list.** If you made an appointment through the state registration system that is three weeks or more away, you may get a call to ask if you are interested in being on the standby list. The call may come from a Vermont number or may appear to come from another state. You will only need to answer “yes” or “no.” You will not be asked for your contact information or any other personal information since you are already in our system.\n\nYou will not lose your scheduled vaccination appointment if you join the standby list. But please do not cancel your original appointment since we cannot guarantee you a vaccine even if you are called. If you do get your vaccine earlier, then the clinic staff will cancel your original appointment.\n\nIf you are called, you would need to be able to arrive 30 minutes before the end of the clinic. You’ll be told what that time is when you are called. Clinics happen both weekdays and some weekends and are held during the day and sometimes in the evening.",

Rates are commonly used because they allow us to compare the number of cases across towns that have different population sizes.\n\nTo calculate the rate by town in the last two weeks, we take the number of cases reported in the last two weeks in a town and divide it by that town’s population. That number is multiplied by 10,000 people. This is the rate, or number of cases per 10,000 people.\n\nUse the map to compare how prevalent COVID-19 is in a town over the past two weeks, relative to other towns. The map may help communities assess how their town is doing and take additional actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when necessary.\n\nWhen looking at the town rates, please remember that having a lower rate of recent cases is not the same as “safer.” We know the virus is in our communities, and we should continue to follow health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19 – no matter where we live or where we visit.

Information about these variants is rapidly emerging. Scientists are working to learn more about how easily they spread, whether they could cause more severe illness, and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect people against them.\n\nMultiple COVID-19 variants are circulating globally, namely in the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa and Brazil. According to the CDC, these variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. You can find a [map showing the number of confirmed cases caused by variants in the U.S](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html).\n\nThe Health Department is working to detect any potential variants of concern — through genetic sequencing of certain specimens taken from various parts of the state and through wastewater testing in Burlington. We will continue this work, to help Vermonters understand any changes in the virus that may require us to strengthen our prevention efforts. You can find a table that shows the [cumulative number of variants identified in Vermont](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/covid-19-communities#variants) by county of residence. It does not reflect the actual number of variants circulating. The table is updated on Tuesdays and Fridays.\n\nHere is what you can do to protect yourself and your community:\n\n*   Keep up with prevention steps, like wearing masks, staying 6 feet apart, staying home if you are sick, washing your hands often, and avoiding crowded places. Prevention steps continue to be effective against variants.\n*   Get tested if you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 or if you think you have any symptoms, even if they are mild. While a test is not able to determine if a variant is present, knowing that you have COVID-19 as soon as possible will help protect yourself and your community.\n*   Get vaccinated. So far, studies suggest that the vaccines available now will help our bodies fight against strains of the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nLearn more about what we know, what we don’t know, and what the CDC is doing about [variants of the COVID-19 virus](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant.html).",

Generally, appointments are required, although some clinics may be able to accept walk-ins. When that happens, we will share that information on [our website](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine) and on our [@healthvermont social media channels](https://www.healthvermont.gov/media/social).\n\nAlready have an account set up? [**Log in to your account**](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration) to make an appointment.\n\nAnyone who is unable to make their appointment online, needs help, or who wants to speak with someone in a language other than English can call **855-722-7878**. This phone line is TTY enabled.\n\nYou can also make an appointment directly through [Kinney Drugs](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/), [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine), [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/schedulevaccine), [Northfield Pharmacy](http://www.northfieldpharmacy.com/) or [UVMMC Outpatient Pharmacies](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/departments-and-programs/pharmacy-services/schedule-your-covid-19-vaccine).\n\n**Create an Account**\n\nYou will need to create an account in our online system first, and then log in to schedule your appointment.\n\nYou will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person. Learn more about [what to do if you don’t have an email address](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4811).\n\nIf you already have an account because you were tested for COVID-19 through a Health Department site, you need to use the same account information to schedule an appointment to get a vaccine. The online system will not allow you to create a new account if you use an email address that is already in the system.\n\n[**Create an account**](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration).\n\n**Make a Vaccine Appointment**\n\nThe name of the vaccine offered at the clinic is listed after the “event” description. However, there is no way to search for an appointment based on which vaccine is available.\n\nSome vaccine clinics are drive-through clinics. If they are, you will see “Drive Thru” listed in the “event” description.\n\nYou can find a different appointment or adjust other appointment search criteria without losing your information. Click “CANCEL” to leave the “Schedule Appointment” screen, click on “Search Event” in the menu to the left, change your search criteria, and then click “Schedule Appointment” to jump back to where you were.\n\n[**Make a vaccine appointment**](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#appointment).\n\nYou can also watch videos on how to:\n\n*   [make your vaccine appointment online](https://youtu.be/4baPyZvfiz4)\n*   [add a dependent or spouse to your account](https://youtu.be/Dpo4NXMO04U)\n\nTalk with your health care provider if you've had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine, injectable therapy, or polysorbate, or if you have questions about whether getting the vaccine is right for you because of health conditions, allergies, or other vaccines you've received recently.

You will need to get out of your car and go inside. All vaccine clinics will be handicap accessible. **Wheelchairs** are available at all Health Department vaccination sites and at hospitals.\n\n**Language interpreters** (including ASL) can be arranged at Health Department vaccination sites. Usually, the interpreter will work with you remotely by phone or video conference through a computer available at the site. To request an interpreter, ask one of the public health workers at the site. Some sites, including Burlington and Winooski, will have in-person interpreters based on demand for these services in the area. If you will need an ASL interpreter at the vaccine clinic, you can select “ASL” as your preferred language when you are making an appointment through the Health Department website.\n\nIf you need **physical assistance** getting to your vaccine appointment, you can have one other person come with you. You will both have your temperatures taken and will be asked questions to determine if you have any current COVID-19 symptoms. If either of you do, then the person who has symptoms won’t be allowed to go any further.\n\nYou will both need to wear masks during your appointment. If you do not have one, there will be masks available at the clinic. If you have trouble breathing, are unable to remove your mask by yourself, or have a medical reason for not wearing one, you will not be required to wear a mask.\n\nFind out what to do if [you need a ride to your appointment](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4799).",

You can make an appointment for a family member, someone who lives with you, someone you care for, or a client.\n\nIf you are scheduling an appointment for someone else, we recommend that you create an account, and then sign them up under your account as a “dependent/household member/client.” Below are the step-by-step instructions. You can also watch a [video on how to make an appointment online](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#video) and find [tips for making an appointment](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-MakingVaccineAppointmentTips.Feb2021.final_.pdf).\n\nIf you would like to make an appointment for someone at the same time as your own, you will need to make the appointments individually. Learn more about [making two appointments at the same time](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4805).\n\nAnyone who is unable to make their appointment online, needs help, or who wants to speak with someone in a language other than English can call **855-722-7878** and press 1 for interpretation services, Monday through Friday from 8:15 a.m. – 5:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. This phone line is TTY enabled.\n\n**1. Create an account.**\n\nFirst, you will need to create an account in our online system. You will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person. Learn more about [what to do if you don’t have an email address](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4811).\n\nIf you already have an account because you were tested for COVID-19 through a Health Department site, you need to use the same account information to schedule an appointment to get a vaccine. The system will not allow you to create a new account if you use an email address that is already in the system.\n\nIf you already have an account, start at the “add a dependent/household member/client” step below.\n\nHere is how you **create an account**:\n\n*   Go to the [COVID-19 Event Portal](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration).\n*   Enter your name, phone number, email address, and date of birth.\n*   Click the “create account” button.\n\nAfter you create an account, an email is immediately sent to the email address you entered. You will need to **verify your account** on the COVID-19 Event Portal to make the person’s appointment:\n\n*   Click on the link in the email sent to you to confirm your account.\n*   Enter your Patient ID number.\n*   Enter your email and date of birth.\n*   Create a password.\n*   Review and consent to the Notice of Privacy Practices.\n*   Enter your personal demographic information.\n*   Enter your vaccine eligibility information, including your passcode (if applicable).\n\n**2. Add a dependent/household member/client.**\n\nYou will need to **add them to your account**. You can watch a [video on how to add a dependent to your account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpo4NXMO04U&feature=youtu.be). Click on the “Add Dependent/Household Member/Client” button at the top of the screen. After consenting, you will need to enter their personal information:\n\n*   Name\n*   Email address (use your email, the same one used to set up your account)\n*   Phone number\n*   Select how you would like to receive communication and documents from the Health Department.\n*   Date of birth\n*   Address\n*   Enter their vaccine eligibility information, including their passcode (if applicable).\n\nIf the person getting the vaccine does not live in Vermont, the system will ask do they work in Vermont or recently moved to Vermont. If none of these apply, they won’t be able to get vaccinated in Vermont, and should seek a vaccine in the state where they live.\n\n**3. Schedule a vaccine appointment**.\n\nClick the “Schedule Vaccine Appointment” button at the top of the screen and select their name. Select a clinic site location by searching by county and date range.\n\nNext, you will answer a series of medical (see below) and demographic questions as well as questions about any COVID-19 symptoms the person has. You also will be asked to complete a waiver.\n\nFinally, choose an appointment slot from the list of available appointments. Click the “submit” button. You may be redirected to choose a different location and time depending on their vaccine eligibility. Once you make an appointment, you will immediately receive an email confirmation.\n\nThese are the **medical screening questions** asked:\n\n1.  **Have you had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a vaccine. They should consider contacting their health care provider if they have questions.\n2.  **Have you had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy?** If the answer is yes, then they will be asked to contact their health care provider for a referral to an allergy/immunology specialist who can determine if they can safely receive the vaccine.\n3.  **Are you currently sick with COVID-19 or still in your isolation period following a COVID-19 infection?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.\n4.  **Have you had a vaccine in the past 14 days or is a vaccination scheduled in the next 8 weeks?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.\n5.  **Have you received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19 in the past 90 days?** If the answer is yes, then they will need to wait for 90 days before scheduling an appointment.\n6.  **Do you have a weakened immune system caused by something such as HIV infection or cancer or do you take immunosuppressive drugs or therapies?** If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.\n7.  **Are you lactating or breastfeeding?** If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.",

            "answer": "**I am pregnant or breastfeeding. Can I get the vaccine?**\n\nYes. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine. You might want to talk with your health care provider to help you decide whether to get vaccinated. While this conversation might be helpful, it is not required before you get your vaccine.\n\nBased on how these vaccines work in the body (that is, they do not reproduce inside your body’s cells), experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant, people who are lactating or breastfeeding babies. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people. Additionally, there are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people who are breastfeeding, the effects of the vaccines on milk production or excretion, or the effects of vaccination on the breastfed baby.\n\nFor more information, watch the video [Sara Asks about the COVID-19 Vaccine](https://youtu.be/Idq1kyVwZHk), which is also [available in other languages](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/resources/multilingual-resources). Learn more from the CDC about [vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html)\n\nPregnant people with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 — including hospitalization, intensive care, a ventilator or special equipment to help them breathe, and death — compared with non-pregnant people. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth (delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks). Learn more from the CDC about [COVID-19 and pregnancy](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html).\n\nWe don’t know for sure if people with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies through their breast milk, but the current evidence suggests that it is not likely.

You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot. This is why it is so important to continue following the [prevention steps](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4782), like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, and to follow the [social gathering](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) guidelines, even after you’ve been vaccinated.\n\nIt may be hard to tell the difference between side effects from the vaccine and symptoms from sickness if you get infected with COVID-19 between vaccine doses. While everyone’s reaction may be different, [vaccine side effects](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4822) usually start within 12 to 24 hours after your vaccination. They should go away within a few days.\n\nIf symptoms get worse or last longer than a few days, contact your health care provider. They should be able to suggest next steps and maybe a COVID-19 test.

Both of them are over 94% effective with two doses.\n\n*   Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are given about 21 days apart.\n*   Doses of the Moderna vaccine are given about 28 days apart.\n\nFor the vaccine to be the most effective and help prevent you from getting COVID-19, it’s best to get your second shot as close to the recommended schedule as possible. It is okay to get your shot 4 days before the recommended schedule. But if you miss your second dose, get it as soon as you can. However, if you are not able to get it close to the recommended schedule, it is okay to get it up to 42 days after your first dose.

This standard is what is most commonly used to assess other vaccines like the flu shot. We cannot directly compare the effectiveness of the three vaccines because they were not studied against each other at the same time. Each clinical trial had different study protocols, timing and location. For example, variants weren’t widely circulating when the earlier vaccines were being tested.\n\nThe vaccines available have similar side effects.

This means that it can take 2 to 14 days after being exposed to get symptoms or to test positive. If you are **not** fully vaccinated, you should get tested twice — as soon as 2 days after the exposure and again 7 days after the exposure if you:\n\n*   think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or\n*   are a close contact.\n\nFor your initial test, if the result is **negative**, you will need to remain in quarantine and follow guidance provided by the Health Department. If the result is **positive**, you must follow isolation guidance provided by the Health Department.\n\nGetting tested right away means you may be able to find out if you have COVID-19 early. This initial test also helps the Health Department find other people who have COVID-19 more quickly.\n\nGetting tested before day 7 cannot be used to end quarantine early.

They might even affect your daily activities but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Common side effects are:\n\n*   Pain, swelling or redness on the arm where you got the shot\n*   Tiredness\n*   Headache\n*   Chills\n*   Muscle or joint pain\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n\n**What to do about side effects:**\n\n*   After your vaccine, you can take pain relievers for any side effects you may have from the vaccine to help you feel better. Don't take them before you get the vaccine to prevent side effects.\n*   Call your health care or vaccine provider if side effects are worrying you or if they don’t go away after a few days.\n*   You can use V-safe to tell the CDC about any side effects and to get reminders for your second dose. V-safe is an optional smartphone tool that uses text messages and web surveys to provide personalized check-ins. Learn more and [register for V-safe](http://www.cdc.gov/vsafe). If you don’t have a smartphone, a family member can sign up for you.\n*   If you have a bad reaction after getting vaccinated, you or your health care provider can report it to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Call 1-800-822-7967 or [report it online](http://www.vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html).\n\nLearn about [why it is important to get two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4830).",

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671) (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nAntigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n*   **For surveillance purposes**, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.\n\nWhen used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests are different from [antibody (serologic) tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4654), which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\nAntigen test results cannot be used to test out of quarantine early.

We strongly recommend Vermonters get both doses for the highest level of protection from COVID-19.\n\n**Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19.** Since the beginning, we have followed the science. Participants in the clinical trials who did not receive both doses were not followed for a long period of time, so we do not know for sure how well or how long one dose will protect you.\n\n**A two-dose vaccine is not new.** For some vaccines, like hepatitis B, shingles and HPV, two doses produce longer-lasting protection. While the first dose gets your immune system ready and offers some protection, the second dose boosts that protection by using your body’s new immune cells it created after the first dose. This “booster” increases the strength of your new antibody protection and makes it last longer.\n\n**Taking the full course of vaccine offers better protection against variants of the virus.** In fact, being only partially vaccinated, for example getting only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, could increase the risk of vaccine-resistant [variants of the virus that causes COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4777). This is because the virus could be weakened with some antibody protection, but not stopped completely, creating the potential for the virus to mutate.\n\n**Some people experience stronger side effects after the second shot.** Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have equal doses in their first and second shots, but for some, stronger side effects are part of their body’s normal immune reaction to that “boost” in protection. Common side effects reported were pain at the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness and headache. These side effects typically go away within a few days.\n\nWhether you experience side effects or not, rest assured the vaccine is working to protect you, your family and your community.\n\nFind out [when you need to get your second shot](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4802).",

We recommend bringing your vaccine card to your second dose appointment, but it is not required.\n\nYou may want to protect your card.

Also, if booster shots are needed, they won’t be able to be recorded if the card is laminated.\n\nIf you lost your vaccine card or your information is wrong, the Vermont Immunization Registry has your vaccination record.

This type of blood clot is found in the blood vessels that drain blood from the brain and is combined with low platelets.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of these side effects in Vermont.\n\nThe pause was necessary to give the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices time to review [additional data](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-04-23.html) about the reported side effects.\n\nVermont’s health care providers have been given information and guidance about the potential blood clotting symptoms and appropriate medical treatment. They will be given any updated guidance.\n\nAlthough the [side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/JJUpdate.html#symptoms-list-question) of concern are extremely rare, the FDA and CDC recommend that **you should contact your health care provider right away if you develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks of receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine**.

            "answer": "**Is it possible to get COVID-19 even if I’m fully vaccinated?**\n\nYes. COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious disease, including hospitalization and death. But no vaccine is 100% effective. That means some people who are vaccinated may become infected with COVID-19. This is called a “vaccine breakthrough.” This happens with any vaccine including measles, mumps, flu and others.\n\nAs more people are vaccinated, it is likely that the number of people who get sick with COVID-19 even after getting vaccinated will increase, especially if the amount of COVID-19 virus in our communities remains high. This growing number may sound concerning, but this is expected. Fortunately, the percentage of people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated should stay low. Among those who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated, few will get very sick.\n\n**Community Immunity**\n\nVaccine protection is more than one person being vaccinated. The more virus going around in the community, the higher your chances of coming into close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19. When enough people in a community are protected against a contagious disease, it's very hard for it to spread. It is this community immunity that helps protect us all from getting sick. This is why – until we reach community immunity and the amount of virus in our community goes down – our prevention steps are so important.\n\n**Variants**\n\nScientific studies show that some vaccines may not work as well on some of the variants. Studies with people in real world conditions are ongoing. [Variants are circulating in Vermont](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/covid-19-communities#variants) and the [numbers of people](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/vermont-dashboard) getting sick with COVID-19 is rising. Vermont’s numbers are too small to make any conclusions about the role of variants and the infections among fully vaccinated people that we are seeing. The Health Department is working to increase our ability to sequence more samples and select certain samples, like those among fully vaccinated people to look at more closely.\n\n**Learn more from the CDC about:**\n\n*   [What you should know about the possibility of COVID-19 illness after vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html)\n*   [Vaccine breakthrough cases](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html)",

When can I return to work, school or child care?**\n\nIf you develop new illness symptoms within the first 3 months of recovering from a COVID-19 infection, we do not recommend retesting. Data to date show that a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to 3 months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within 3 months of their initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19.\n\nYou should still stay home when you are sick to prevent spreading illness to others. You should remain home until your symptoms have improved or are gone. If you have a fever, you should stay home until you are fever-free (without the use of fever-reducing medicine) for at least 24 hours. Contact your health care provider if you have questions or concerns.\n\nLearn more about [if people who recover from COVID-19 can be infected again](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4602) and [when you are considered to be recovered from COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).",
