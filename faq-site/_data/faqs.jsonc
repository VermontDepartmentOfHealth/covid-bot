Symptoms may start 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4°F or greater)\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Chills\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\n**Not everyone with COVID-19 has a fever. Even mild symptoms** (like a headache or dry cough) could be signs of COVID-19.\n\n**Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms**. People with COVID-19 who don't have any symptoms can spread the virus to other people.

            "answer": "**How does COVID-19 spread?**\n\n**COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact through respiratory droplets**\n\nCOVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are near each other (within about 6 feet).\n\nWhen people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. Another person can become infected if they inhale the droplets, or if droplets land in their nose or mouth.\n\n**COVID-19 can sometimes spread through airborne transmission**\n\nAs the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away.\n\nThis airborne transmission is uncommon, but has occurred in situations such as indoors when a person with COVID-19 had symptoms and been coughing for longer than 30 minutes. Other examples include shouting, singing or exercising, or being in a [building without proper ventilation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) that allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\n**COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces**\n\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is **not** thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes.\n\nNot everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks), group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes), and other places where it’s not possible to stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nMasks are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also **not required for** – and should not be worn by:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance\n*   Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask\n\n**If you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing**, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.\n\nBusinesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).\n\nIn **private settings** (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a mask anytime you’re around people you don’t live with.\n\nPeople with COVID-19 can spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. **Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you** from getting or spreading COVID-19. In addition to wearing masks, these are things you can do:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your [social circle](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [CDC’s guide to masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) – how to choose, wear, store and wash masks\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of **free cloth masks** to the public.

Generally, these are people you were within 6 feet of, for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, during the [time they were infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734) (contagious).\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out [what you need to do if you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\n**If you are** _**not**_ **identified as a close contact**, then you will not be called. While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and [get tested on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) or after if you have not had any symptoms. Learn more about [quarantine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4618).\n\nIf you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to follow the prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your [social circle](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

The infectious period starts two days before any symptoms began – or for people with COVID-19 who don't have symptoms, two days before they got tested – and continues [until they are recovered](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nClose contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a short period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**\n\n*   You live in the same home.\n*   You are intimate partners.\n*   You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.\n*   You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** _**not**_ **close contacts:**\n\n*   You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n*   You were their server at a restaurant.\n*   You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n*   You were in front of the person in line at the store.\n*   You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact**, you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out [what you need to do if you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

Find out the [current gathering restrictions](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\nIf you are around other people, it’s safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19.\n\nGathering in groups or “pods” related to education or child care that are already formed can continue. Gathering in pods related to social activity, informal playgroups, playdates, or sleepovers are not allowed at this time. New pods of any kind are discouraged.\n\nFor **outdoor recreation** with people you don’t live with, keep a physical distance of at least 6 feet and wear a mask. There are no other limitations to outdoor activities. Being active outside is good for our mental and physical health!\n\nFollow these general [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask (children over 2 who are able) anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nChildren can also continue to take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends and family. These changes will continue to be difficult, but we are all doing our part to slow down this pandemic.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Resources for families with children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/families-children)\n*   [Coping with family stress during COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/coping-stress)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [Frequently asked questions about school and child care](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#families-with-children-school)",

Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.\n*   **Get support from others.** Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning.

Wearing a mask protects both you and the people around you from getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThere are several [types of masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/types-of-masks.html) to choose from, including cloth, disposable, N95 and KN95.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the most effective fabrics for **cloth masks** are:\n\n*   tightly woven fabrics, such as cotton and cotton blends\n*   breathable\n*   two or three fabric layers\n\nYou can also wear a **disposable mask**, like a surgical or medical procedure mask, instead of a cloth mask, now that they are in greater supply. These masks may provide some additional protection.\n\nThe CDC has found that “double masking” or **wearing two masks** (disposable mask underneath **and** a cloth mask on top) can offer a better fit and provide extra protection.\n\nTypically **N95** masks should be reserved for health care workers who are at highest risk and need them most. **KN95** masks are also available for the public to purchase, but make sure the mask has been [approved by the Food & Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas).\n\nWhichever mask you choose, **it is important to make sure it fits properly**. Learn more from the CDC about [improving how your mask protects you](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/effective-masks.html).\n\nThe CDC continues to study the effectiveness of different types of masks, and we will update our recommendations as new scientific evidence becomes available.",

At this time, your [social circle](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).",

Therefore, if a person who has recovered from COVID-19 has new symptoms of COVID-19, the person may need an evaluation for reinfection, especially if the person has had close contact with someone infected with COVID-19.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is **not** thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes. \n\nStores and food service establishments no longer provide plastic bags at check-out. You have the option to purchase paper bags for 10 cents each or use reusable bags. If a store has temporarily banned reusable bags, consider putting your groceries back into your cart and bag them at your car.\n\nMake sure you clean your reusable bags regularly, which can also help prevent illnesses from bacteria, such as _E.coli_, that are from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n\nFind more information and tips about the [single-use plastics ban](https://dec.vermont.gov/content/single-use-products-law) from the Department of Environmental Conservation.",

You will need to follow all [cross state travel guidelines](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/restart/cross-state-travel) when you return to Vermont.\n\nThe exemption to quarantine only applies to the person under essential travel rules. It does not apply to anyone else who travels with you. For example, you travel for work and your child comes with you. Your child will need to quarantine for 14 days when you return to Vermont, but you won’t need to.\n\n**If you live within 5 miles of the Vermont border**, you may make day trips without quarantining if you travel 5 miles into a neighboring state or into Vermont for an essential purpose or for certain activities.

Outdoor basketball courts may be open to shoot hoops, but contact games are not allowed. Do not share sports equipment with people you don’t live with.\n*   **Be cautious and choose low-risk activities to avoid injury.** This will help lower the burden on our hospitals and health care system.\n*   **Respect signs for closed areas, trails and land.** Check [Trail Finder](https://www.trailfinder.info/) to see if your trail is currently open before you visit.

We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.\n\nIf a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time [while the person was infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.\n\nVermont is taking measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities, including nursing homes, assisted living facilities, residential care homes, therapeutic community residences, residential treatment centers, correctional facilities, state psychiatric care facilities, and homeless shelters.\n\nIf a staff member or resident tests positive for COVID-19, facility-wide testing of staff and residents might be recommended in consultation with the Health Department. If facility-wide testing is recommended, the Health Department provides technical assistance to make sure that the facility is connected with testing resources and provides guidance on when additional rounds of testing should take place. The Health Department also works closely with the facility to provide infection control guidance and resources.\n\nAdditionally, many long-term care facilities are conducting ongoing staff surveillance testing. For related guidance, read the [Long Term Care Guidance for Operations During COVID-19 Health Emergency](https://dail.vermont.gov/sites/dail/files/documents/Long%20Term%20Care%20Operational%20Guidance.FINAL_clean1.pdf) from the Department of Disabilities, Aging and Independent Living (DAIL) and [Testing Recommendations for Long-term Care Facilities](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-LTCFSurveillanceTesting.pdf) from the Health Department.\n\nThere is a table showing [active outbreaks in long-term care facilities](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/health-care-professionals/long-term-care-and-group-living-settings), which is updated on Tuesdays and Fridays.

            "answer": "**What is serologic, or antibody, testing?**\n\nSerologic, or antibody, tests identify people who have previously been infected with the coronavirus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\nIf someone was infected with COVID-19, there will be antibodies in their blood, whether the person ever felt sick or not. The testing measures the body’s immune response to the virus. It does not detect the virus itself.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nThe CDC is working with commercial laboratories to [estimate the percentage of people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) who were infected with the COVID-19 virus. The strategy involves working with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to better understand COVID-19 in the United States using serology testing for surveillance.\n\nGet more information about the [COVID-19 tests that are currently available](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food and Drug Administration.",

While there is no specific treatment, someone sick with COVID-19 should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\nThe CDC has advice on how to protect yourself or others if you are [caring for someone sick at home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) or in a non-health care setting. You can learn what to do when someone has symptoms of COVID-19, when someone has been diagnosed with COVID-19, or when someone has tested positive but is not showing symptoms.\n\nIf you take care of someone who is in isolation because they tested positive for COVID-19 and you cannot avoid close contact with them, then you need to quarantine. This means you should stay home and away from other people while the person you are caring for is sick and for 14 days **after** they are able to end [home isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nFind tips about [quarantining when you share a home](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_Prevention-Extended-Families-English.pdf).",

It is sometimes referred to as an RT-PCR test. PCR stands for polymerase chain reaction. The test identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus.\n\nPCR tests are generally the most reliable tests. Samples are analyzed at a lab, which usually takes up to a few days.

            "answer": "**What is contact tracing?**\n\nContact tracing is used to provide education, support and guidance to people who are diagnosed with an infectious disease. It’s also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.\n\n**If you test positive for COVID-19**, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. The contact tracer **does not** enforce rules. You **will not** get in trouble if you gathered with people or did not follow protocols.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. Find out [what you need to do if you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\n**It’s important to answer the call** and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus. Governor Scott’s [Executive Order](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%208%20TO%20AMENDED%20AND%20RESTATED%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) calls on Vermonters to comply with all contact tracing requests.\n\nAll restaurants and other businesses are keeping a 30-day log of employee and guest names and contact information in case contact tracing is needed.\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nCurrently, Vermont is not participating in the contact tracing notifications that are available on some cell phones. We are waiting to see how successful this service is in other states who are participating. If it’s proven to be effective, we will consider using it.\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

According to the CDC, it is currently thought that the risk of getting COVID-19 from properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is low because the wastewater treatment process removes and degrades many viruses and bacteria. There has been no information to date that anyone has become sick with COVID-19 because they came in contact with wastewater.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large rainstorms during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rainstorms, and do not swallow the water.\n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, plan to “arrive, play, and leave” — avoiding gathering before and after activities and giving others space. Follow these steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with. (You don’t have to wear a mask while you are in the water, but you should continue to stay at least 6 feet away from others.)\n\nLearn more about [healthy swimming](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/index.html) from the CDC.",

Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus. \n\nHowever, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth.\n\n**Make sure your face shield fits properly**. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece. Clean them regularly – especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield – and [handle them like masks](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4723) when putting them on or removing them.\n\n**People who have trouble breathing** can wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom, or a face shield. \n\n**Outdoor workers** who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a mask when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people). It is important that workers keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when they are not wearing a mask.",

This is why there is the option for people to be tested on day 7 or after in their quarantine and, if the test is negative, to end quarantine. The test must be a PCR test.\n\nThe CDC has released [new options to shorten quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). These options allow state and local public health authorities to determine and establish the quarantine options for their jurisdictions.\n\nAt this time, there are no plans to change Vermont's existing policy, which calls for a 14-day quarantine, or gives the option to get a PCR test on day 7 or later to end quarantine early with a negative test, as long as the person continues to have no symptoms.\n\nThis policy, implemented in May, is well-understood by Vermonters and our data show it has worked to prevent further spread of COVID-19.

In private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a mask anytime you're around people you don’t live with.\n\nPeople with COVID-19 can spread the virus even if they don’t have any symptoms. Masks protect others around you as well as offer some protection to you.\n\nA mask must be worn properly to be effective and avoid spreading the virus:\n\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before putting it on.\n*   Put it over your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin.\n*   Make sure it fits snugly against the side of your face.\n*   Slip the loops over your ears or tie the strings behind your head.\n*   Do not touch it when you are wearing it.\n*   Remove it by handling only the ear loops or ties and fold the outside corners together.\n*   Be careful not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately after removing it.\n\nWash your mask regularly and make sure it’s completely dry before using it again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate them for washing and have enough clean ones to wear.\n\n**During hot weather**, if you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot, take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.\n\n**During cold weather**, change your mask when it becomes wet. Keep a spare mask to replace the wet one, and put the wet one in a plastic bag until you get home. If you need to wear a scarf, ski mask or balaclava, wear it over your mask. If you wear glasses, find a mask that fits closely over your nose or has a nose wire to help reduce fogging.\n\nWearing masks is one way we can help slow the spread of COVID-19 – in addition to staying at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with and other [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [CDC’s guide to masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) – how to choose, wear, store and wash masks\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth masks to the public.

In private settings, we recommend that you wear a mask anytime you're around people you don’t live with. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537), by respiratory droplets released when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing them from droplets getting into their eyes. Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.\n\n**If you have trouble breathing or if you work in a setting where it is difficult to wear a mask**, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth. People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom. In [school settings](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/guidance-strong-healthy-start-health-guidance), students and adults are allowed to wear face shields, and in [child care settings](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Health-Guidance-Childcare-Summer-Programs.pdf), providers, teachers and staff are allowed to wear face shields.\n\n**Make sure your face shield fits properly**. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

Based on current data and levels of the COVID-19 virus in Vermont, it is safe – and important – for children to go to school or child care for in-person learning. The Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics asked schools to prioritize in-person attendance for preschool to grade 5, and for students with special needs.\n\nWe know much more about the virus now than we did in March when schools closed for the spring. The Health Department can track data in real-time and respond to cases quickly with our contact tracing teams. We also have robust testing and [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) system in Vermont that will support schools in containing the virus if there is a case.\n\nChildren need structure, relationships with their peers, teachers, and other adults for their academic, social, and emotional development. Although remote learning is an important tool during the pandemic, it can lead to even greater gaps in equity. Public health and education experts considered all these factors when writing Vermont’s guidance to reopen schools, which focuses on the safety of teachers, staff, and students.\n\nWe are seeing more cases of COVID-19 in children nationwide and in Vermont, but that is not surprising as states have reopened, and more testing has become available.\n\nVermont has seen cases in schools, but by following health guidance, we are all working together to keep the virus out of schools as much as possible and prevent it from spreading through physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene, and contact tracing.\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [What parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf)\n*   [Returning to school following illness](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/CYF_VT%20BacktoSchoolAfterIllness10.6.pdf)\n*   [Returning to child care or an out of school care program following illness](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/CYF_VT%20BacktoChildCareAfterIllness10.6.pdf)\n*   [What if there is a case of COVID-19 in school?](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4738)\n*   [COVID-19 cases in K-12 learning communities while infectious](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Transmission-Schools.pdf)\n*   [Information for families with children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/families-children)\n*   [School-based sports program guidance](https://accd.vermont.gov/news/update-new-work-safe-additions-stay-home-stay-safe-order#sports-and-organized-sports)\n*   [Music education guidance](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/strong-and-healthy-start-safety-and-health-guidance-for-music-education)",

Do I need to quarantine?**\n\nIf you are dropping off a college student at a Vermont college or at an out-of-state college, there are two options:\n\n1.  You follow the State of Vermont’s [cross state travel guidance](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/restart/cross-state-travel).\n2.  You do a “contactless” drop-off while under quarantine conditions.\n\nHere are the quarantine conditions for option 2:\n\n*   You must travel by personal vehicle to and from Vermont.\n*   Do not enter any college facilities. You may help the student unload at the curb only.\n*   Wear a mask any time you are outside of your vehicle.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n*   You may stay overnight at a lodging property only if you quarantine at that property for your entire stay. This means you must stay in the room or house and not leave to go to the grocery store, restaurants or any other places where you might come into contact with other people. You may not use lodging property amenities such as pools, spas, gyms, recreation equipment or other general use facilities.\n*   If you are coming to Vermont and staying with family and friends at their home, you must quarantine during your entire stay. This means you need to stay at least 6 feet from the people who are hosting you, wear a mask in common spaces, use a separate bathroom, eat separately, and otherwise not be in close contact with the people who are hosting you.\n\nYou may have one additional person with you during drop-off, but they must also follow these quarantine options.\n\n[**If you are fully vaccinated**](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4825), you do not need to quarantine when you to travel to or return to Vermont.\n\nCheck with the school before you travel to find out if there are any move-in restrictions or rules.",

            "answer": "**How can I be safe from COVID-19 infection and prevent an overdose?**\n\n[Substance use may increase the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations/people-who-use-drugs/QA.html), but more evidence is needed. At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl (an opioid) in them. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\n**If you are alone:**\n\n*   Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them you’re going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they don’t hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.\n*   Call [Never Use Alone](http://neverusealone.com/) at 800-648-3570 or message them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Neverusealone/). They’ll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you don’t respond after a certain period of time.\n*   Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**If you’re not alone:**\n\n*   Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people you’re with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household don’t need to stay 6 feet apart.\n*   Anyone in the room should wear a mask if they are not using and not part of your household.\n*   Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they aren’t using at the moment.\n*   Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:**\n\n*   Use one drug at a time (don’t mix).\n*   Know your tolerance. Use less if you haven’t used in a while, or if you’ve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\n*   Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\n*   Start low and go slow. You can use more later.\n*   Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\n*   Consider getting on medication-assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\n*   Call 802-565-LINK or go to [VTHelplink](https://vthelplink.org/app/account/opa_result) to find a treatment center or connect to syringe service providers.\n\n**About wearing masks:**\n\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you can’t take your own mask off (like if you’re nodding out), you shouldn’t wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.\n\n**More information:**\n\n*   [Tips to prevent an opioid overdose](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   [Helping during an overdose and finding Naloxone](https://www.healthvermont.gov/emergency/injury/opioid-overdose-prevention) (Health Department)\n*   [Guidance for People Who Use Substances on COVID-19](https://yale.app.box.com/v/COVID19HarmReductionGuidance) (Yale)\n*   [Safer Drug Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak](https://harmreduction.org/miscellaneous/covid-19-guidance-for-people-who-use-drugs-and-harm-reduction-programs/?utm_source=all+IRETA+communications&utm_campaign=c611c175b0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_16_01_32&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5cec8dc768-c611c175b0-137425257&mc_cid=c611c175b0&mc_eid=7bcfbcf675) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   Find a [syringe service program](https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/hiv-std-hepatitis-community-resources/syringe-service-programs) near you.

            "answer": "**How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?**\n\nBecause of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\n\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you don’t live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\n*   **How big the space is** – Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\n*   **How many people are in the room or area** – A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\n*   **How much ventilation there is** – Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. If it is too cold outside to open windows, then setting up a fan to pull air out of the room can reduce your risk. However, using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\n*   **How humid the room or area is** - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you can, run a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40% in the room or area where people are gathering.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your [social circle](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Improving ventilation in your home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/Improving-Ventilation-Home.html) from the CDC\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC",

Materials with tighter weaves, like cotton T-shirt material, are better at trapping respiratory droplets and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus than materials with loose weaves, like gaiters.\n\nIf you choose to wear a gaiter as a face covering, fold it over so it is two layers. Based on a few experiments in adults, gaiters with one layer trap the least amount of respiratory droplets. Gaiters with two layers trap more droplets than gaiters with one layer. Gaiters folded over into two layers have similar effectiveness at trapping respiratory droplets as two layers of cotton T-shirt material.\n\nLearn more about [different types of masks](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4597).",

Before you get together, start with an open and honest conversation about what everyone has been doing to stay healthy and how they have been socializing. Consider everyone’s worries, boundaries and possible COVID-19 exposure risk so you can all get on the same page.\n2.  **Focus on what you need**. Using “I” instead of “you” statements helps people avoid feeling defensive or judged. In fact, blaming and shaming may actually increase push back and the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors. We recommend sharing what you’re comfortable with based on your own perspective instead of making demands of others.\n3.  **Share why it is important to you**. Share what level of risk works for you and why. It might be different for others. Some people feel comfortable taking on a moderate amount of risk in their lives. Others may not feel comfortable taking on any risk. Focusing on your own reasons for staying safe can help people to better understand and get on board.\n4.  **Set boundaries and stick to them**. We are all for keeping it friendly, open and non-judgmental – but that doesn’t mean you have to skimp on your safety! It’s OK to be clear and straightforward with what you need to feel safe and comfortable. It’s also okay to decline invitations or leave situations that feel too risky. You should never have to feel bad or apologize for prioritizing your safety. Lead by example by sticking to what works for you and avoiding judgment.\n\nFind some [examples of the “COVID Talk”](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/tips-you-get-together).",

Isolation means you need to stay home and away from other people, until you have recovered. This is to prevent further spread of the virus. A [contact tracer](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) will call you to give you guidance. They will answer any questions you may have and see if you need help getting resources to stay home.\n\nMost people with mild illness can recover at home. While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\nIf you or a family member are sick, follow these steps to care for yourself and to help protect other people in your home and your community:\n\n*   **Stay home**, except to get medical care. Call ahead before visiting your health care provider. Anyone who does not have a health care provider can call 2-1-1 to be connected to care or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n*   **Separate yourself** from other people and pets.\n*   **Monitor your symptoms**.\n*   **Wear a mask** when you're around people and pets.\n*   **Cover your coughs and sneezes** with your sleeve or a tissue. Then throw the tissue in the trash.\n*   **Wash your hands often**. Use an alcohol-based sanitizer if soap and water aren't available.\n*   **Avoid sharing** personal household items.\n*   **Clean all high-touch surfaces** in your home daily.\n*   **Get support from others**. Stay in touch with family and friends by phone, email or online platform.\n*   **Monitor your blood oxygen levels**. People diagnosed with COVID-19 may have below-normal levels of oxygen in their blood before they feel short of breath. Finding low oxygen levels early can help you know to seek medical care sooner.

In situations where you **cannot** avoid close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should quarantine while the person you are caring for is sick. You should also quarantine for 14 days **after** they are able to end [home isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nQuarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from other people. Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days since the day you were potentially exposed. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms. Learn about the [option to be tested](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) to end quarantine after 7 days.\n\nFind tips on what to do [when a household member is sick with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_Prevention-Extended-Families-English.pdf).",

For example, if someone under quarantine depends on another person for care and basic needs, and close contact cannot be avoided, the caregiver may continue with activities outside of the home. For example, the caregiver may continue to go to work, school, child care, the grocery store, etc.\n\nAs much as possible, continue to practice these prevention steps:\n\n*   Stay at least 6 feet from the person who is under quarantine.\n*   People who are under quarantine should wear a mask in common spaces, use a separate bathroom, eat separately, and otherwise not be in close contact with others in the household who are not under quarantine.\n*   Be sure to disinfect commonly touched surfaces, and check yourself for symptoms for 14 days.",

Since then, the Health Department has tracked probable cases and taken the same public health actions as if they were a confirmed case (confirmed means the person tested positive on a PCR test).\n\nThis means that contact tracers conduct interviews with people who are considered probable cases, provide isolation guidance, and their close contacts are notified to quarantine.

Rates are commonly used because they allow us to compare the number of cases across towns that have different population sizes.\n\nTo calculate the rate by town in the last two weeks, we take the number of cases reported in the last two weeks in a town and divide it by that town’s population.

This is the rate, or number of cases per 10,000 people.\n\nUse the map to compare how prevalent COVID-19 is in a town over the past two weeks, relative to other towns. The map may help communities assess how their town is doing and take additional actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when necessary.\n\nWhen looking at the town rates, please remember that having a lower rate of recent cases is not the same as “safer.” We know the virus is in our communities, and we should continue to follow health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19 – no matter where we live or where we visit.

At this time, your [social circle](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nThe Health Department also strongly recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get their flu shot. The flu vaccine is available in your doctor’s office and at pharmacies around the state. This will help prevent the potential harm of getting the flu and COVID-19 – at the same time or in succession.

Information about these variants is rapidly emerging. Scientists are working to learn more about how easily they spread, whether they could cause more severe illness, and whether currently authorized vaccines will protect people against them.\n\nMultiple COVID-19 variants are circulating globally, namely in the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa and Brazil. According to the CDC, these variants seem to spread more easily and quickly than other variants, which may lead to more cases of COVID-19. You can find a [map showing the number of confirmed cases caused by variants in the U.S](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html).\n\nThe B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, has now been detected in many U.S. states and we do expect to see it in Vermont as well.\n\nThe Health Department is working to detect any potential variants of the virus — through genetic sequencing of certain specimens taken from various parts of the state and through wastewater testing in Burlington.

It takes time for the vaccine to train your body to fight COVID-19. You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot.\n\nThe vaccine protects you from illness, but we don’t know for sure if you can give the virus to someone else. Some [recent studies](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4831) suggest that a person who is vaccinated is less likely to infect other people with the COVID-19 virus. Until enough people are vaccinated and we know more, it is important to continue following the prevention steps, like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, even after you’ve been vaccinated.\n\nIf it has been 14 days since you got your final vaccine dose, **you do not need to quarantine if**:\n\n*   You travel to or return to Vermont.

You can make an appointment for your loved one or someone you care for who is [currently eligible](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#eligiblenow), especially if they need help creating an account and making an appointment online.\n\nAnyone who is unable to make their appointment online, needs help, or who wants to speak with someone in a language other than English can call 855-722-7878.\n\nIf you are making an appointment online **for a spouse or partner at the same time as your own**, you will need to make the appointments individually. Learn more about [making two appointments at the same time](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4805).\n\nIf you are a **case worker who is scheduling an appointment for your client**, please call 855-722-7878 Monday through Friday from 8:15 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. and Saturday to Sunday 10:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m.\n\nIf you are **scheduling an appointment for a family member**, we recommend that you create an account, and then sign them up as a “dependent.” You can watch a [video on how to make an appointment online](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#video) and find [tips for making an appointment](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-MakingVaccineAppointmentTips.Feb2021.final_.pdf). Here are the steps you will need to take:\n\n**1. Create an account.**\n\nFirst, you will need to create an account in our online system. You will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person. Learn more about [what to do if you don’t have an email address](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4811).\n\nIf you already have an account because you were tested for COVID-19 through a Health Department site, you need to use the same account information to schedule an appointment to get a vaccine. The system will not allow you to create a new account if you use an email address that is already in the system.\n\nIf you already have an account, start at the “add a dependent” step below.\n\nHere is how you **create an account**:\n\n*   Go to the [COVID-19 Event Portal](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration).\n*   Enter your name, phone number, email address, and date of birth.\n*   Click the “create account” button.\n\nAfter you create an account, an email is immediately sent to the email address you entered. You will need to **verify your account** on the COVID-19 Event Portal to make the person’s appointment:\n\n*   Click on the link in the email sent to you to verify your account.\n*   Enter your Patient ID number.\n*   Create a password.\n*   Review and consent to the Notice of Privacy Practices.\n*   Enter your personal information.\n\n**2. Add a dependent**.\n\nYou will need to **add them as a dependent**. You can watch a [video on how to add a dependent to your account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpo4NXMO04U&feature=youtu.be). Click on the “Add Dependent/Spouse” button at the top of the screen. After consenting, you will need to enter their personal information:\n\n*   Name\n*   Email address (use your email, the same one used to set up your account)\n*   Phone number\n*   Date of birth\n*   Address\n\nIf the person getting the vaccine does not live in Vermont, the system will ask do they work in Vermont, get primary care in Vermont, or recently moved to Vermont. If none of these apply, they won’t be able to get vaccinated in Vermont, and should seek a vaccine in the state where they live.\n\n**3. Schedule a vaccine appointment**.\n\nClick the “Schedule Vaccine Appointment” button at the top of the screen and select their name. Select a clinic site location by searching by county and date range.\n\nNext, you will answer a series of medical (see below) and demographic questions as well as questions about any COVID-19 symptoms the person has. You will be asked to provide their health insurance information. Insurance is not required, and there is no cost for getting the vaccine. You also will be asked to complete a waiver.\n\nFinally, choose an appointment slot from the list of available appointments. Click the “submit” button. You will immediately receive an email confirmation.\n\nThese are the **medical screening questions** asked:\n\n1.  **Have you ever had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy, an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to a previous dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components (including polyethylene glycol [PEG]), or an immediate allergic reaction of any severity to polysorbate?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get any of the currently available COVID-19 vaccines. They should consider contacting their health care provider if they have questions.\n2.  **Are you currently sick with COVID-19 or still in your isolation period following a COVID-19 infection?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.\n3.  **Have you received another vaccine in the last 14 days?** If the answer is yes, then they won't be able to schedule an appointment right now, but can log back in at a later date to schedule an appointment.\n4.  **Do you have a weakened immune system caused by something such as HIV infection or cancer or do you take immunosuppressive drugs or therapies?** If the answer is yes, then they can make an appointment but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.\n5.  **Do you have a history of a bleeding disorder or are you taking a blood thinner?** If the answer is yes, then they can still get a vaccine, but they may want to talk with their health care provider first about any concerns. People with bleeding disorders or who are taking blood thinners may bruise or have more serious bleeding after injections. Special precautions can be taken to help avoid post-injection bleeding and bruising, such as using a very fine needle and applying pressure to the injection site after the injection.\n6.  **Are you pregnant?** If the answer is yes, then they can make an appointment but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.\n7.  **Are you breastfeeding or lactating?** If the answer is yes, then they can make an appointment but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.\n8.  **Have you received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19 in the past 90 days?** If the answer is yes, then they will need to wait for 90 days before scheduling an appointment.",

You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot. This is why it is so important to continue following the [prevention steps](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4782), like wearing a mask, keeping 6 feet apart, and washing your hands, and to follow the [social gathering](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761) guidelines, even after you’ve been vaccinated.\n\nIt may be hard to tell the difference between side effects from the vaccine and symptoms from sickness if you get infected with COVID-19 between vaccine doses. While everyone’s reaction may be different, vaccine side effects usually start within 12 to 24 hours after your vaccination. They should go away within a few days.\n\nIf symptoms get worse or last longer than a few days, contact your health care provider. They should be able to suggest next steps and maybe a COVID-19 test.

When you are at your first vaccine appointment, someone will help you schedule an appointment to get your second dose of vaccine.

We know how hard it is to be apart from family and friends who we usually celebrate holidays with. Here’s what you need to know:\n\n*   Staying home and with people you live with is still the lowest risk.\n*   If you do gather with people you don’t live with, then you should quarantine after the gathering.\n*   The Health Department strongly encourages getting tested before the gathering, as soon as 2 days after the gathering, and again 7 days after the gathering.\n*   The Health Department strongly advises against travel, even within Vermont. All travel to and from Vermont requires quarantine (unless it’s considered [essential travel](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4637)).\n\nQuarantine means staying home and away from other people for 14 days. If you have not had [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), you have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end your quarantine with a negative test result.\n\nAny time you are around others, remember to add these things: 6-Foot Spaces, Masks on Faces, Uncrowded Places. Imagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. The more layers there are, the safer everyone will be. Learn more about [COVID-19 prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nRemember, the virus can spread easily among family and friends — because they are the ones we are often in close contact with — when they don’t know they have it. Like other aspects of our lives, holidays will look different and we need to do everything we can to keep each other safe.\n\nFind information for [communities of faith](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/communities-faith).\n\n**Find more tips from the CDC:**\n\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays/winter.html)\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings)\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event)",

Data to date show that a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to 3 months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within 3 months of their initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19. \n\nYou should still stay home when you are sick to prevent spreading illness to others. You should remain home until your symptoms have improved or are gone. If you have a fever, you should stay home until you are fever-free (without the use of fever-reducing medicine) for at least 24 hours. Contact your health care provider if you have questions or concerns.\n\nLearn more about [if people who recover from COVID-19 can be infected again](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4602) and [when you are considered to be recovered from COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).",

You will need to quarantine if you are a close contact or live with someone who tests positive for COVID-19. If you are identified as a close contact, you will be contacted. This is known as contact tracing. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time.\n\nLearn more about [what to expect from contact tracing](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4682).\n\nFind tips about [quarantining when you share a home](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_Prevention-Extended-Families-English.pdf).",

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671) (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nAntigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n*   **For surveillance purposes**, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.\n\nWhen used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests are different from [antibody (serologic) tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4654), which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Use of Antigen Testing in Vermont – Health Update October 1, 2020](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-AntigenTesting.pdf)\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food and Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

We strongly recommend Vermonters get both doses for the highest level of protection from COVID-19.\n\n**Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19.** Since the beginning, we have followed the science. Participants in the clinical trials who did not receive both doses were not followed for a long period of time, so we do not know for sure how well or how long one dose will protect you.\n\n**A two-dose vaccine is not new.** For some vaccines, like hepatitis B, shingles and HPV, two doses produce longer-lasting protection. While the first dose gets your immune system ready and offers some protection, the second dose boosts that protection by using your body’s new immune cells it created after the first dose. This “booster” increases the strength of your new antibody protection and makes it last longer.\n\n**Taking the full course of vaccine offers better protection against variants of the virus.** In fact, being only partially vaccinated, for example getting only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, could increase the risk of vaccine-resistant [variants of the virus that causes COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4777). This is because the virus could be weakened with some antibody protection, but not stopped completely, creating the potential for the virus to mutate.\n\n**Some people experience stronger side effects after the second shot.** Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have equal doses in their first and second shots, but for some, stronger side effects are part of their body’s normal immune reaction to that “boost” in protection. Common side effects reported were pain at the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness and headache. These side effects typically go away within a few days.\n\nWhether you experience side effects or not, rest assured the vaccine is working to protect you, your family and your community.\n\nFind out [when you need to get your second shot](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4802).",

Mail will take about one week. Find out [how to request your vaccine record](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/IMR_Requesting_Vaccine_Records.pdf).",

How do I make an appointment for a vaccine?**\n\nThere are certain medical conditions that put people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 as identified by the CDC. If you have a high-risk health condition (listed below), you do not need to contact your health care provider to get documentation of the condition.\n\nYou will make an appointment in our system in the same way as Vermonters who have been eligible by age. You can watch [videos for help making an appointment online](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#video).\n\nYou will be asked some questions. First, you will say that you have one of the health conditions that makes you eligible for a vaccine. This will serve as a self-certification. We trust you to work with us and help make sure that these Vermonters at highest risk due to a medical condition are protected.\n\nWhen making your appointment, you will also be asked to provide information for a health care provider you see for the condition, if you have one. But if you don’t have a health care provider, you can still get a vaccine.\n\nThe Health Department may use the information you provided to confirm your eligibility, either through medical records or by contacting your provider. We may also reach out to people who don’t have a provider to offer a connection to care.\n\n[Make an appointment to get the COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine).\n\n**The high-risk health conditions are**:\n\n*   Current cancer\n*   Chronic kidney disease\n*   COPD, including emphysema and chronic bronchitis\n*   Heart disease, including heart attack, heart failure, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease (angina, acute and chronic ischemic heart disease), cardiomyopathies, and pulmonary hypertension.
