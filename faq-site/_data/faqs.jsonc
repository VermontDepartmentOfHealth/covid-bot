Symptoms may start 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4°F or greater) or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\n**All Vermonters with even mild symptoms are encouraged to contact their health care provider to get tested.** Your provider will test you at their office or refer you for testing nearby. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\n[Learn more about COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19).",

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.\n\nOne important difference between COVID-19 and the flu is that we have a vaccine for the flu!\n\nIt’s more important than ever to get your flu shot this year, when flu viruses and the new coronavirus may be spreading at the same time. [Learn more about the flu and find a flu shot](https://www.healthvermont.gov/immunizations-infectious-disease/influenza/prevention).\n\nBecause some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two:\n\n*   COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people.\n*   It can take longer before people show symptoms of COVID-19, and people can be contagious with the COVID-19 virus for longer.\n\nDoctors and scientists are working to estimate the death rate of COVID-19, but currently, it is thought to be substantially higher (possibly 10 times or more) than that of most strains of the flu.\n\nFind more information about [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) from the CDC.\n\nThere are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading the flu and COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19).",

When will a vaccine be available?**\n\nThere is no vaccine for COVID-19, but research and work are underway to develop one.\n\nThe Health Department is keeping a close watch on the vaccine development process to be sure we can trust that that science governs the process. The pressure to get a vaccine quickly must not outweigh the importance of its safety and efficacy.\n\nWe stand together with other health departments across the country, as well as the national Association of Immunization Managers, in our insistence that any vaccine made available to the public must first meet all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety standards, and be recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent national advisory committee.\n\nFind out more about what Vermont is doing to [prepare for a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19-vaccine).\n\nWhile we wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Health Department strongly recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get their flu shot. The flu vaccine is available in your doctor’s office and at pharmacies around the state. This will help prevent the potential harm of getting the flu and COVID-19 – at the same time or in succession.

            "answer": "**How does COVID-19 spread?**\n\n**COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact through respiratory droplets**\n\nCOVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are near each other (within about 6 feet).\n\nWhen people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. Another person can become infected if they inhale the droplets, or if droplets land in their nose or mouth.\n\n**COVID-19 can sometimes spread through airborne transmission**\n\nAs the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away.\n\nThis airborne transmission is uncommon, but has occurred in situations such as indoors when a person with COVID-19 had symptoms and been coughing for longer than 30 minutes. Other examples include shouting, singing or exercising, or being in a [building without proper ventilation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) that allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\n**COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces**\n\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is **not** thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes.\n\nNot everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19), and learn more from the CDC about [how to protect yourself and others from getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).",

While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/MIS-C-Fact-Sheet.pdf). Currently, information about MIS-C is limited, and the CDC is working to learn more.\n\nYou can teach your children to do the same things everyone can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19).\n\nSocializing for children is important for their development and wellbeing.

Is there a mask mandate?**\n\nYou are required to wear a face mask or covering in public spaces in Vermont any time it is not possible to keep a 6-foot distance from others who are not part of your household. This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nFace masks or coverings are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also not required for – and should not be worn by:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance\n*   Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask\n\nIf you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.\n\nBusinesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, these are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [How to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to follow a few key [prevention tips](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19). If you think you should be tested for COVID-19, talk with your health care provider. If you don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nThe Health Department **recommends testing** for:\n\n*   People with [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).\n*   People who have had [close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf) (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\n*   People who are referred by their health care provider for testing for another reason.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested before visiting another household or attending a gathering just to make sure they're okay.** You could have already been exposed but may have been tested too early for it to show up on the test, or you could be exposed to COVID-19 after you are tested. Testing is not [prevention](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19), and a negative test does not necessarily mean it is safe to gather with others.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested frequently.** We do not recommend routine, repeated testing just for peace of mind. While testing supplies are currently in adequate supply, we need to use what we have wisely.\n\nThere is no cost to individuals for the COVID-19 test.\n\nThe number of Vermonters who were tested for COVID-19 is updated daily on the [Current Activity in Vermont data dashboard](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont).",

Traveling out of state is not recommended since the virus is still widespread in neighboring states and across the country.\n*   Be aware of your surroundings. Choose outdoor settings over indoor settings.

Minimize close contact while talking or doing anything that requires exertion, shouting or singing.\n*   Keep your social circle small. Choose a few other trusted households that are also taking health and safety precautions.\n\nThe CDC recommends [other populations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations.html) also take extra precautions, like pregnant people, people experiencing homelessness, and people with disabilities.",

Generally, these are people you were within 6 feet of, for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, during the [time they were infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734) (contagious).\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** a contact tracer will call you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2020/10/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home.\n\n**If you are** _**not**_ **identified as a close contact**, then you will not be called. While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call from the Health Department, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and get tested on day 7 or after if you have not had any symptoms.\n\nIf you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to follow the prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19).\n\n[Learn how contact tracing for COVID-19 works in Vermont.](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing)",

However, the Health Department recommends keeping groups as small as possible to help prevent the spread of the virus. In addition, municipalities may choose to limit the size of gatherings and limit the hours for the sale of alcohol, meaning they could set a curfew for bars and clubs.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19.

Data to date show that a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to three months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within three months of initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19.\n\nThere are no confirmed reports to date of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within three months of initial infection. However, additional research is ongoing. Therefore, if a person who has recovered from COVID-19 has new symptoms of COVID-19, the person may need an evaluation for reinfection, especially if the person has had close contact with someone infected with COVID-19. The person should isolate and contact a health care provider to be evaluated for other causes of their symptoms, and possibly retested.",

The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is **not** thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes. \n\nStores and food service establishments no longer provide plastic bags at check-out. You have the option to purchase paper bags for 10 cents each or use reusable bags. If a store has temporarily banned reusable bags, consider putting your groceries back into your cart and bag them at your car.\n\nMake sure you clean your reusable bags regularly, which can also help prevent illnesses from bacteria, such as _E.coli_, that are from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n\nFind more information and tips about the [single-use plastics ban](https://dec.vermont.gov/content/single-use-products-law) from the Department of Environmental Conservation.",

The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to follow a few key [prevention tips](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19). If you think you should be tested for COVID-19, talk with your health care provider. If you don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nThe Health Department **recommends testing** for:\n\n*   People with [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).\n*   People who have had [close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf) (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\n*   People who are referred by their health care provider for testing for another reason.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested before visiting another household or attending a gathering just to make sure they're okay.** You could have already been exposed but may have been tested too early for it to show up on the test, or you could be exposed to COVID-19 after you are tested. Testing is not [prevention](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19), and a negative test does not necessarily mean it is safe to gather with others.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested frequently.**\n\nWe do not recommend routine, repeated testing just for peace of mind. While testing supplies are currently in adequate supply, we need to use what we have wisely.\n\nFind more information about [testing and testing locations](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-covid-19) including frequently asked [questions about pop-up testing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/testing-covid-19).\n\nFind out [what to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html) from the CDC and what to do while you’re [waiting for test results](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Waiting-For-Test-Results-English.pdf).",

We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.\n\nIf a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time [while the person was infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.\n\nVermont is taking additional measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities. This includes nursing homes, corrections facilities, residential homes for those with disabilities, residential treatment centers, assisted living facilities, state psychiatric care facilities, and homeless shelters.

In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nThe CDC is working with commercial laboratories to [estimate the percentage of people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) who were infected with the COVID-19 virus. The strategy involves working with state, local, territorial, academic, and commercial partners to better understand COVID-19 in the United States using serology testing for surveillance.\n\nGet more information about the [COVID-19 tests that are currently available](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food and Drug Administration.",

[Weekly summaries of Vermont COVID-19 data](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont#datasummaries) are also available, and they include more details on who has been impacted by COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nHealth equity exists when all people have a fair and just opportunity to be healthy – especially those who have experienced socioeconomic disadvantage, historical injustice, and other systemic inequalities. Therefore, our epidemiology team collaborated with Vermont Information Technology Leaders (VITL) to cross-reference medical records to gain more robust race information about COVID-19 cases in Vermont.\n\nWe can use this data to help to prevent the spread of illness, improve care for patients, and present a more complete picture of how COVID-19 may be affecting everyone in Vermont.",

It’s also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.\n\n**If you test positive for COVID-19**, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** a contact tracer will call you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed.

They will attempt to leave a message asking you to return a call from the Vermont Department of Health.\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nAlso, consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nThe risk for severe illness increases with age and is higher for older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions. They should consider [taking additional steps to limit their risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4559), stay close to home, and family and friends should do everything they can to help keep them safe.\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [How to safely connect with friends and family](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Safely_Connect_with_Friends_and_Family_FINAL.pdf)\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) from the CDC",

According to the CDC, it is currently thought that the risk of getting COVID-19 from properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is low. There has been no evidence that a person can get COVID-19 by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large rainstorms during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rainstorms, and do not swallow the water. \n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, plan to “arrive, play, and leave” — avoiding gathering before and after activities and giving others space. Follow these steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask any time you’re not in the water and can’t keep 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [healthy swimming](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/index.html) from the CDC.",

People visiting or returning to Vermont are strongly encouraged to sign up to get daily reminders by email, text or phone asking if they are experiencing any [symptoms](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19).\n\nSara Alert sends daily reminders until they automatically stop after two weeks since the day you report arriving in Vermont. If you are going to be in Vermont for at least two weeks, it’s important to stay enrolled for the entire monitoring period to help our public health response to COVID-19.\n\nIf symptoms are reported, a member of our team will reach out to provide guidance and next steps. Sara Alert is **not **a contact tracing system. It is not GPS-based, so it does not monitor someone's movements or track their location. \n\nHere are some reasons why you should sign up for Sara Alert:\n\n*   You get fast, easy, and free reminders to check yourself for symptoms.\n*   You get quick access to the Health Department for guidance and information if you develop symptoms.\n*   It helps our public health teams contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIf you are currently enrolled in Sara Alert and have questions about your messages, email the Travel Team at [ahs.vdhcovid19returntravelerinquiries@vermont.gov](mailto:ahs.vdhcovid19returntravelerinquiries@vermont.gov) or call 802-863-7240 (option 6).\n\n[Sign up for Sara Alert](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/EpiInfoWebSurvey/Home/9c2e5941-1ba7-4ab4-84be-558ba7684f5d).",

Face shields are generally not recommended because they are more for health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in. However, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a cloth face mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier on your nose and mouth.\n\nOutdoor workers who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a face mask or covering when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people). It is important that workers keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when they are not wearing a mask.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece. Clean them regularly – especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield – [handle them like face masks or coverings](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4723) when putting them on or removing them.",

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a newer type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nThough antigen tests may be available in Vermont, the Health Department only recommends antigen testing in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n\nWhen used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nWe are monitoring how these antigen tests evolve and how results can best be used. Right now, people who test positive from antigen tests are not considered to have a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 and are not included in our total number of cases. However, we consider these cases “presumptive positives” and recommend they follow the same guidelines as a positive case to stay home (self-isolate). We also conduct [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) and recommend a PCR test to confirm the positive result.\n\nAntigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the coronavirus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Use of Antigen Testing in Vermont – Health Update October 1, 2020](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-AntigenTesting.pdf)\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food & Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, do these things to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19: stay home if you are sick, wash your hands often, keep your social circle small, and stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nA face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n*   Wash your hands before putting it on.\n*   Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n*   Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n*   Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n*   Keep it on until you get home.\n*   Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n*   Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nIf you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot outside, you should take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.\n\n**Learn more:** \n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [How to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

In private settings with people you don’t live with, we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537), by respiratory droplets released when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.\n\nIf you have trouble breathing or if you work in a setting where it is difficult to wear a face mask or covering, wearing a face shield is better than wearing nothing over your nose and mouth. People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom. In [school settings](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/guidance-strong-healthy-start-health-guidance), students and adults are allowed to wear face shields, and in [child care settings](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Health-Guidance-Childcare-Summer-Programs.pdf), providers, teachers and staff are allowed to wear face shields.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

The Health Department can track data in real time and respond to cases quickly with our contact tracing teams. We also have robust testing and [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) system in Vermont that will support schools in containing the virus if there is a case.\n\nChildren need structure, relationships with their peers, teachers, and other adults for their academic, social, and emotional development. Although remote learning is an important tool during the pandemic, it can lead to even greater gaps in equity. Public health and education experts considered all these factors when writing Vermont’s guidance to reopen schools, which focuses on the safety of teachers, staff, and students.\n\nWe are seeing more cases of COVID-19 in children nationwide and in Vermont, but that is not surprising as states have reopened, and more testing has become available.\n\nWe recognize there may be cases in schools as they reopen. This is why Vermont’s reopening guidance outlines ways to keep the virus out of schools and prevent it from spreading through physical distancing, face masks or coverings, hand hygiene, and contact tracing.\n\nLearn more about [what parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf) as schools reopen for the fall.",

            "answer": "**How can I be safe from COVID-19 infection and prevent an overdose?**\n\n[Substance use may increase the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations/people-who-use-drugs/QA.html), but more evidence is needed. At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl in them, an opioid. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\n**If you are alone:**\n\n*   Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them you’re going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they don’t hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.\n*   Call [Never Use Alone](http://neverusealone.com/) at 800-648-3570 or message them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Neverusealone/). They’ll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you don’t respond after a certain period of time.\n*   Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**If you’re not alone:**\n\n*   Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people you’re with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household don’t need to stay 6 feet apart.\n*   Anyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.\n*   Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they aren’t using at the moment.\n*   Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:**\n\n*   Use one drug at a time (don’t mix).\n*   Know your tolerance. Use less if you haven’t used in a while, or if you’ve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\n*   Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\n*   Start low and go slow. You can use more later.\n*   Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\n*   Consider getting on medication-assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\n*   Call 802-565-LINK or go to [VTHelplink](https://vthelplink.org/app/account/opa_result) to find a treatment center.\n\n**About wearing face masks or coverings:**\n\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you can’t take your own mask off (like if you’re nodding out), you shouldn’t wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.\n\n**More information:**\n\n*   [Tips to prevent an opioid overdose](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   [Helping during an overdose and finding Naloxone](https://www.healthvermont.gov/emergency/injury/opioid-overdose-prevention) (Health Department)\n*   [Guidance for People Who Use Substances on COVID-19](https://yale.app.box.com/v/COVID19HarmReductionGuidance) (Yale)\n*   [Safer Drug Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak](https://harmreduction.org/miscellaneous/covid-19-guidance-for-people-who-use-drugs-and-harm-reduction-programs/?utm_source=all+IRETA+communications&utm_campaign=c611c175b0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_16_01_32&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5cec8dc768-c611c175b0-137425257&mc_cid=c611c175b0&mc_eid=7bcfbcf675) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   Find a [syringe service program](https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/hiv-std-hepatitis-community-resources/syringe-service-programs) near you.

A contact tracer calls the person who tested positive (or their parent) within 24 hours, asks them questions about their recent activities and who they’ve been in contact with during their infectious period, and gives instructions on staying home. The team contacts the school if the person was there while infectious. Schools do not need to take action if someone with COVID-19 was not at the school during their infectious period.\n\nThe Health Department will:\n\n*   Work closely with the school and ask about who had close contact (for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with the person with COVID-19 while they were infectious, like classmates and teachers. Information that identifies the individual will only be shared if consent was given.\n*   Reach out to all people with close contact and give them information about quarantine and testing.\n*   Discuss next steps with school administration, including whether to temporarily move to remote instruction.\n\nThe school will:\n\n*   Close off any areas where the person spent longer than 15 minutes (like a classroom, gym, or a cafeteria) then clean and disinfect the areas.\n*   Communicate with parents and staff about the situation, and encourage everyone to answer calls from the Health Department for contact tracing, if they get called. Contact tracers only call the people who our infectious disease experts determine have had close contact with a person with COVID-19 while they were infectious.\n*   Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the school.\n*   Make sure that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 stays home from school (isolation) until they can return.\n*   Make sure that anyone who had close contact with someone with COVID-19 while they were infectious stays home from school (quarantine) until they can return. Someone under quarantine does not have COVID-19 and cannot pass it to others, but they may become infected within 14 days.\n\nLearn more about the [Health Department's response to COVID-19 cases](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-Flowchart-When-Someone-Tests-Positive.pdf) and find a [school-by-school listing of COVID-19 cases](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Transmission-Schools.pdf) in Vermont K-12 schools.\n\nSeveral resources for school administrators, nurses and COVID coordinators are available on the [Health Department School web page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/schools-colleges-child-care-programs) including a quick reference guide for when [someone with COVID-19 was at school while infectious](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-School-Case-Quick-Reference.pdf).\n\nLearn more about [what parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf) as schools reopen for the fall and [when your child can return to school after being sick](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/CYF_VT%20BacktoSchoolAfterIllness10.6.pdf).",

Many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.\n\nOne of the health effects that the CDC is closely watching and working to understand relates to COVID-19 and the heart. Heart conditions associated with COVID-19 include inflammation and damage to the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, or inflammation of the covering of the heart, known as pericarditis. These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. Heart damage may be an important part of severe disease and death from COVID-19, especially in older people with underlying illnesses. Heart damage like this might also explain some frequently reported long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart palpitations.\n\nThe risk of heart damage may not be limited to older and middle-aged adults. For example, young adults with COVID-19, including athletes, can also suffer from myocarditis. Severe heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare. There may be more cases of mild effects of COVID-19 on the heart that can be diagnosed with special imaging tests, including in younger people with mild or minimal symptoms; however, the long-term significance of these mild effects on the heart are unknown. The CDC will continue to assess and provide updates as new data emerge.",

            "answer": "**How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?**\n\nBecause of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\n\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you don’t live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\n*   **How big the space is** – Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\n*   **How many people are in the room or area** – A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\n*   **How much ventilation there is** – Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. If it is too cold outside to open windows, then setting up a fan to pull air out of the room can reduce your risk. However, using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\n*   **How humid the room or area is** - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you can, run a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40% in the room or area where people are gathering.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/preventing-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) from the CDC",

Here are four tips to help have the “COVID Talk” – a conversation to negotiate boundaries and establish expectations ahead of time.\n\n1.  **Ask questions**. Before you get together, start with an open and honest conversation about what everyone has been doing to stay healthy and how they have been socializing. Consider everyone’s worries, boundaries and possible COVID-19 exposure risk so you can all get on the same page.\n2.  **Focus on what you need**. Using “I” instead of “you” statements helps people avoid feeling defensive or judged. In fact, blaming and shaming may actually increase push back and the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors. We recommend sharing what you’re comfortable with based on your own perspective instead of making demands of others.\n3.  **Share why it is important to you**. Share what level of risk works for you and why. It might be different for others. Some people feel comfortable taking on a moderate amount of risk in their lives. Others may not feel comfortable taking on any risk. Focusing on your own reasons for staying safe can help people to better understand and get on board.\n4.  **Set boundaries and stick to them**. We are all for keeping it friendly, open and non-judgmental – but that doesn’t mean you have to skimp on your safety! It’s OK to be clear and straightforward with what you need to feel safe and comfortable. It’s also okay to decline invitations or leave situations that feel too risky. You should never have to feel bad or apologize for prioritizing your safety. Lead by example by sticking to what works for you and avoiding judgment.\n\nFind some [examples of the “COVID Talk”](https://www.HealthVermont.gov/StaySafeVT).",

Like other aspects of our lives, this holiday season will look different and we need to do everything we can to keep each other safe.\n\nIf you are thinking about travel, take these steps:\n\n1.  [Check the map](https://dfr.vermont.gov/about-us/covid-19/modeling/covid-19-modeling-graphics) to find out the risk of COVID-19 infection at your destination.\n2.  [Decide if the risk](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/deciding-to-go-out.html#risk-going-out) is worth it for your family.\n3.  [Plan to have a safe trip](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-risk.html), remain flexible and get your [flu shot](https://www.healthvermont.gov/immunizations-infectious-disease/influenza/prevention).\n4.  [Quarantine](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/traveling-vermont) when you return.\n\nIf people are visiting you, they will need to quarantine at the place they are staying for 14 days. (They have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end their quarantine with a negative test result). If you are hosting them, you don’t also need to quarantine, but you’ll need to make sure there is a [separate space](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4704https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/) for the people in quarantine.\n\nBe sure to talk to the people you plan to visit or who are visiting you about your comfort level with [COVID-19 prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nCelebrating holidays within your own household or sharing a meal virtually will not be the same as we’re used to, but we need to keep our guard up and continue to do all we can to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19.",
