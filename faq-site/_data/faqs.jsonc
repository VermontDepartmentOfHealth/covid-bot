Because people may have COVID-19 but no symptoms, wearing a face mask may help keep people from spreading the virus. \n\n Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing (or “social distancing”) and other prevention measures. **The most effective way to slow the spread is to continue to follow the governor’s Stay Home, Stay Safe Order, and social distancing, as well as regularly washing hands and not touching your face.** \n\nMedical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth or other recommended face coverings for your yourself and loved ones.\n\n If you feel sick, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are sick and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit. Your doctor can provide guidance on how to avoid spreading illness, such as what steps to take while traveling to their facility and upon arrival, and whether you should wear a mask.\n\nLearn more about [using cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).",

However, testing resources in Vermont and in the U.S. are currently limited. For the immediate term, the Health Department lab will prioritize testing samples from the following groups with symptoms of COVID-19: health care workers, patients who are hospitalized, long-term care facility residents, people who are incarcerated, people who are immunocompromised, and other high-priority groups with symptoms. All other samples submitted to the lab will be tested as quickly as resources allow. \n\nAs of March 27, the Health Department announced new guidance to expand testing to include more people with mild to moderate symptoms. The process is still the same – if you are having symptoms of COVID-19, you should call your health care provider to arrange for being tested.\n\nHealth care providers are encouraged to order a test for any adult or child who is showing symptoms of COVID-19. \n\nAnyone who meets the medical requirements for testing for COVID-19 can be tested at no cost. \n\nThe number of Vermonters who were tested for COVID-19 is updated daily on the [Current Activity in Vermont data dashboard](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont).",

Businesses must follow [new guidelines from the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD)](https://accd.vermont.gov/news/update-new-work-safe-additions-stay-home-stay-safe-order) that requires employees to wear non-medical cloth face coverings (bandanna, scarf, or non-medical mask, etc.) over their nose and mouth when in the presence of others.\n\nBusinesses, nonprofit and government organizations that do not meet the criteria outlined in this first phase must suspend in-person operations and ensure all workers work remotely whenever possible.\n\nOperations that can be conducted online or by phone, or sales that can be facilitated with curbside pickup or delivery only, can continue, including restaurants that were providing takeout service under the previous closure order. Otherwise, non-exempt businesses must close.\n\nEssential services and functions remain in operation. Businesses and entities providing services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security can remain in operation and are not subject to suspend in-person operation restrictions, but are expected to adhere to social distancing, hygiene and cleaning requirements.

There are currently no travel restrictions for travel within the U.S. or specific health-related recommendations upon return. However, cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in many states, and some areas are experiencing community spread of the disease. Crowded travel settings, like airports, may increase chances of getting COVID-19, if there are other travelers with coronavirus infection. There are several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel.\n\nOn March 28, 2020, the CDC is issued a Domestic Travel Advisory for residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, which advises them to not travel within the U.S. for 14 days, unless it is essential. \n\nHere are considerations:\n\n* Is COVID-19 spreading where you’re going?\n\n* Will you or your travel companion(s) be in close contact with others during your trip?\n\n* Are you or your travel companion(s) at higher risk of severe illness if you do get COVID-19?\n\n* Do you have a plan for taking time off from work or school, in case you get exposed to, or are sick with, COVID-19?\n\n* Do you live with someone who is 65 years or older or who has a serious underlying medical condition?\n\n* Is COVID-19 spreading where you live?\n\nCDC has information about travel in the United States here: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html) Because guidance keeps evolving, you can watch that page for the latest information.",

While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\n* As much as possible, stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom. Stay at least six feet away from others in your home at all times. Don’t share household items.\n\n* Have someone else care for your pets. Although no pets have been reported to get sick with COVID-19, people with the virus should limit contact with animals until more information is known. If you do care for your pet, wash your hands before and after.\n\n**Daily cleaning and washing:**\n\n* Clean and disinfect surfaces in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.\n\n* Thoroughly wash household items, like utensils, after using.\n\n* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

This happens when caring for, being intimate partners with, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area. If you have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19: stay home, limit contact with others, and monitor yourself for symptoms. You do not need to call the Health Department. \n\nFor those who have tested positive for COVID-19, the Health Department is looking into possible travel or exposure history and identifying anyone with whom they have had close contact. They will be assessed for their exposure risk and given health guidance. Where appropriate, they will receive recommendations for home isolation or other restrictions. For the purpose of identifying close contacts, the infectious period starts two days (48 hours) before any symptoms began and continues until the person has recovered.\n\nClose contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. In these situations, you should observe yourself for symptoms. You do not need to call the Health Department\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**    \n\n* You live in the same home.    \n\n* You are intimate partners.     \n\n* You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.     \n\n* You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** ***not*** **close contacts:**\n\n* You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n\n* You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n\n* You were in front of the person in line at the store. \n\n* You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\nAnyone who develops symptoms should stay home and call their health care provider.\n\nFind out more about [what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf).",

Take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends. Some of these changes will be difficult, but we can all do our part to slow down this pandemic.\n\nWhen you’re out walking or spending time in your backyard, remember that ticks are active this time of year.

            "answer": "**Do homemade face masks work?** Wearing a homemade face mask or covering can offer some protection to others. This is because people may be infected with COVID-19 and not show symptoms for up to two days (48 hours). The face mask can contain respiratory droplets and prevent them from spreading to others. While health care workers may be able to use homemade masks as a last resort, medical-grade masks are considered personal protective equipment. These should be reserved for health care workers. \n\nLearn more about [using cloth face coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).",

Staying away from friends and family can make the feeling of isolation worse. We encourage all Vermonters to keep connections with family, friends, and your community in new ways. Use technology to communicate, enjoy the outdoors, take time to learn a new skill, follow up on long overdue projects, or volunteer to support those who may be in need. \n\n It is important to get outside for fresh air and exercise. Spend time outdoors as a family or consider individual outdoor activities like biking or hiking, as it’s easier to keep a good distance from each other. When you’re out walking or spending time in your backyard, remember that ticks are active this time of year. Stay safe by checking regularly for ticks and wearing EPA-registered tick repellents.

This includes the recommendation of the federal government that those who have passed through or left New York City should self-monitor and stay home for a period of 14 days. \n\nThis does not include people who have crossed into Vermont for “essential purposes.” This includes travel required for personal safety; food, beverage or medicine; medical care; care of others; and to perform work, services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. For more details, see the [Governor’s Addendum 6](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%206%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) to the Stay Home, Stay Safe Order.\n\nFor those who have crossed into Vermont for non-essential purposes and are being asked to stay home: While in quarantine, residents and non-residents may need to rely on neighbors, friends or family living outside of the household to deliver groceries to their home. Check your local grocery store to see if there is an option for home delivery or look for online sources for home delivery. Groceries should always be left at your door. Wash your hands before and after if a signature for receipt is required. Learn more about quarantine on the [What is isolation, quarantine and self-observation?](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-chart-observation-isolation-quarantine_final.pdf) chart.\n\nVisitors are instructed not to travel to Vermont if they are displaying symptoms or if they are traveling from cities and regions identified as COVID-19 “hot spots,” including, among others, the states of Florida and Louisiana and the cities of Detroit, Chicago and New York City. \n\nIn addition, residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut should stay in their home states in strict compliance with CDC travel guidance issued Saturday, March 28, 2020. This is essential if you will be in close contact with  older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions. \n\nFor more information, see the [Governor’s Addendum 7](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-7-executive-order-01-20) to the Stay Home, Stay Safe Order.",

Exercise and taking in Vermont’s natural beauty is important for our mind and bodies. We can safely continue to enjoy the outdoors with these measures:\n\n* **Stay close to home.** Find areas close you can walk or bike to. If you must drive, please limit the distance from home to ten miles, and only drive with members of your household.\n\n* **Practice social distancing while outside.** You lower your risk when you stay at least 6 ft apart from others. This includes having your dog on a leash and close to you.\n\n* **Bring a cloth face mask with you.** Put a [cloth face mask](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) on if you encounter other people and stop to chat.\n\n* **Be cautious and choosing low-risk activities to avoid injury.** This will help lower the burden on our hospitals and health care system. \n\n* **Respect signs for closed areas, trails and land.** Check [Trail Finder](https://www.trailfinder.info/) to find out if your trail is currently open before you visit.\n\n* Check for ticks and wear an EPA-registered tick repellent. When you’re out walking or spending time in your backyard, remember that ticks are active this time of year.

In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the test’s effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nWe will continue to use public health best practice – considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level – to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.",

We recognized the need to include this information to help us understand how Vermonters were being affected by COVID-19, but in our earlier efforts to respond to the pandemic, race and ethnicity data was not always collected for each patient.\n\nHealth equity exists when all people have a fair and just opportunity to be healthy – especially those who have experienced socioeconomic disadvantage, historical injustice, and other systemic inequalities. Therefore, our epidemiology team collaborated with Vermont Information Technology Leaders (VITL) to cross-reference medical records to gain more robust race information about COVID-19 cases in Vermont. At the end of March, race was unknown in 73% of cases, but through our joint work, we have brought that number down to just 8%. We have been able to partner with VITL through a state directive issued in response to the State of Emergency.\n\nWe can use this data to help to prevent the spread of illness, improve care for patients, and present a more complete picture of how COVID-19 may be affecting everyone in Vermont.",
