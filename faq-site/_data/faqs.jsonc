Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4 °F or greater) or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\nCall your health care provider if you are having symptoms.

Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.\n\n* Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n* Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with. \n\n* Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\n* Wear a [cloth face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, at a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.\n\n* Stay home when you are sick.\n\n* Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.

            "answer": "**Should I wear a cloth face mask or covering when I go out in public?**\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, it is more important than ever to make wearing cloth face masks or coverings a habit and to bring one with you whenever you leave home. Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.\n\nAs part of Governor Scott’s [Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase 3](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%2012%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20%20.pdf), people are required to wear cloth face masks or coverings over their nose and mouth when using public transportation—including buses, trains and ride services, and in mass transportation stations or terminals, including airports. Additionally, businesses and non-profit and government organizations may require customers or clients to wear cloth face masks or coverings.\n\nThe advice to wear cloth face masks or coverings is based on data about how COVID-19 can spread before a person has any symptoms. Also, people may have COVID-19 but no symptoms and wearing cloth face masks or coverings may help keep them from spreading the virus.\n\n**We all still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people, even when wearing cloth face masks or coverings, practice good hand hygiene and follow the state’s Be Smart, Stay Safe guidance.**\n\nThe cloth face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n*   Wash your hands before putting it on.\n*   Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n*   Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n*   Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n*   Keep it on until you get home.\n*   Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n*   Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nSome people should never wear a cloth face mask or covering, including:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance\n\nMedical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth face masks or coverings for your yourself and loved ones.\n\nIf you feel sick, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are sick and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit. Your doctor can provide guidance on how to avoid spreading illness, such as what steps to take while traveling to their facility and upon arrival.\n\nLearn more about [using cloth face masks or coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) and [face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf).\n\nLearn how to [safely connect with friends and family](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Safely_Connect_with_Friends_and_Family_FINAL.pdf).",

Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?”](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) on this page.\n\nThere is no cost to individuals for the COVID-19 test.\n\nHealth care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. If an asymptomatic patient who is currently in quarantine would like to end their quarantine period early based upon a negative test result, health care providers should refer them to a pop-up testing site on Day 7 or later of their quarantine.\n\nThe number of Vermonters who were tested for COVID-19 is updated daily on the [Current Activity in Vermont data dashboard](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/current-activity-vermont).\n\nThe State began expanding testing in late April. We know that with increased testing we are likely to see a rise in positive cases, and we are prepared to handle such a scenario. A new Testing and Tracing Task Force has been created to guide and oversee this process.",

Traveling out of state is not recommended since the virus is still widespread in neighboring states and across the country.\n*   Be aware of your surroundings. Choose outdoor settings over indoor settings. Pay attention to the size of the space, crowding, the number of people there, and if they are wearing face coverings and keeping a 6-foot distance.\n*   Choose activities that don’t require close contact. Minimize close contact while talking or doing anything that requires exertion, shouting or singing.\n*   Keep your social circle small. Choose a few other trusted households that are also taking health and safety precautions.\n*   Continue your medications and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your health care provider.\n*   Have at least a two-week supply of prescription and non-prescription medications. Consider having your medications delivered.\n*   Talk to your health care provider about whether your vaccinations are up to date.\n*   Do not delay getting emergency care for your underlying medical condition because of COVID-19.\n*   Call your health care provider if you have any concerns about your underlying medical conditions or if you get sick and think that you may have COVID-19.\n\nRead the CDC’s full guidance on [people who are at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html).",

Wear a cloth face mask or covering if you need to leave home for medical care\n\n* **Most people with mild illness can recover at home.** While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\n* **Stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom**, as much as possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others in your home at all times and wear a cloth face mask or covering if you are in the same room with them. Don’t share household items.\n\n* **Have someone else care for your pets.** There have been a small number of pets, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. If you must care for your pet, wear a cloth face mask or covering, and wash your hands before and after.\n\n**Daily cleaning and washing:**\n\n* **Clean and disinfect surfaces** in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.\n\n* **Thoroughly wash household items**, like utensils, after using.\n\n* **Wash your hands often** with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Close contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.\n\nA “long period of time” is hard to define because it depends on whether the person was sick at the time and what type of interaction you had with that person. These examples can help you determine whether you were a close contact or not.\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**\n\n*   You live in the same home.\n*   You are intimate partners.\n*   You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.\n*   You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** _**not**_ **close contacts:**\n\n*   You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n*   You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n*   You were in front of the person in line at the store.\n*   You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\nA team at the Health Department works with people with COVID-19 to identify their close contacts. This is called contact tracing. The team assesses each close contact for their exposure risk and gives them health guidance and recommendations for self-isolation or other restrictions.\n\nAs the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with\neach day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch\nwith those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe chart describing [what is isolation, quarantine and self-observation](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-chart-observation-isolation-quarantine_final.pdf) has details about what you should do and not do, depending on your exposure risk.\n\nFind out more about [what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf).",

Make sure those who need regular medicine, medical supplies and equipment have what they need. \n\n* **Choose a room in your home that can be used to separate sick household members from those who are healthy.** Identify a separate bathroom for the sick person to use, if possible. Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.\n\n* **Make sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine.** Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.\n\n* **Get support from others.** Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially those who are 65 years and older, who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.\n\n* **Take care of the emotional health of your household members.** Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.\n\n* **Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with.** As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nRead [Preventing COVID-19: Tips for Large Households or Extended Families Living in the Same Space](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_Prevention-Extended-Families-English.pdf).

This is because people may be infected with COVID-19 and not show symptoms for up to two days (48 hours). The cloth face mask or covering can contain respiratory droplets and prevent them from spreading to others.\n\nWhile health care workers may be able to use homemade cloth face masks or coverings as a last resort, medical-grade masks are considered personal protective equipment. These should be reserved for health care workers. \n\nLearn more about [using cloth face masks or coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).",

We want to know how we can safely connect and stay physically active, especially as the weather gets warmer.\n\nThe best way to lower our risk of getting or spreading COVID-19 is to stay home, but we have reached a point where we can take small steps to restart in-person connections. However, we all have a responsibility to do so thoughtfully. We are flattening the curve, but it won’t take much for cases and serious illness to quickly rocket back up if we are not careful.\n\nOlder adults (age 65 and over), and people with underlying medical conditions, like heart and lung disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe illness. They should continue to stay at home, and family and friends should do everything they can to help keep them safe.\n\nLearn how to [safely connect with friends and family](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Safely_Connect_with_Friends_and_Family_FINAL.pdf).

However, some stores are choosing to no longer allow reusable bags and containers at this time. Check with your local store for their current policies.\n\nAfter July 1, stores and food service establishments will no longer provide plastic bags at check-out. You’ll have the option to purchase paper bags for 10 cents each or use reusable bags. If a store has temporarily banned reusable bags, consider putting your groceries back into your cart and bag them at your car. Some stores and food establishments may still offer plastic bags after July 1 since they are allowed to use the ones they currently have in stock until they are gone.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus may live for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. It is important to remember to wash your hands before you eat and to avoid touching your face. \n\nMake sure you clean your reusable bags regularly, which can also help prevent illnesses from bacteria, such as _E.coli_, that are from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n\nFind more information and tips about the [single-use plastics ban](https://dec.vermont.gov/content/single-use-products-law) from the Department of Environmental Conservation.",

We currently have a contact tracing team in place, but these are other ways you can help. \n\nPeople with medical or other health care backgrounds are needed to support the health care providers responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vermont’s Medical Reserve Corps units are community-based groups of volunteers who supplement local emergency and public health resources with their existing skills. \n\nSign up with the [Vermont Medical Reserve Corps](https://www.vermont.gov/volunteer) if you:\n\n* Are a licensed and certified health care professional\n\n* Have health, mental health, or other types of clinical or professional experience \n\n* Have health care administrative experience, such as with medical data entry or language translators\n\n* Have worked with displaced individuals, such as homeless shelter programs\n\nVermont has eased licensing requirements for the purposes of aiding this emergency response. Physicians, physician assistants and podiatrists can learn more on the [Board of Medical Practice website](https://www.healthvermont.gov/health-professionals-systems/board-medical-practice/COVID19). Other medical professionals, including nurses and osteopathic physicians, can learn more on the [Office of Professional Regulation's website](https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/about-opr/covid-19-response/).\n\n**Other individuals who have needed skills** (for example, drivers, food service, construction, IT, security, skilled trades, etc.), can sign up at [vermont.gov/volunteer](https://www.vermont.gov/volunteer) and indicate their expertise and availability.\n\nVermonters can also contribute to blood banks, food banks, and other emergency supply efforts. The American Red Cross of Northern New England faces a severe blood shortage and many local food banks and other community organizations are in need of support and donations of supplies. \n\n**Give blood**: Learn how to safely [donate blood with the American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/local/new-hampshire-vermont.html). \n\nSupport your [local Foodbank by donating online](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/) or you can text GIVEHEALTH to 85511. The [Vermont Foodbank can help](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/gethelp) if you need it.\n\nYou can also help your neighbors – older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions should stay home as much as possible. Go shopping for a neighbor or someone else in need, keep an older neighbor company by phone or at a safe distance. When volunteering please follow the [guidelines on being a good neighbor](https://vem.vermont.gov/neighborly).",

Ongoing reduction in cases for at least 14 days\n\n2. A health care system that is safely able to treat all patients without exceeding its capacity or using crisis standards of care\n\n3. The ability to test all people with symptoms\n\n4. Widespread active monitoring of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and tracing their close contacts\n\nAt this time, Vermont is doing well in keeping the number of cases of COVID-19 down. This is hopeful news. To continue on this path, it is critical that Vermonters continue making their day-to-day sacrifices to help save lives. Social distancing (staying at least 6 feet from each other) and wearing cloth face masks or coverings are here to stay for a while, even as we being to reopen, until we have effective antiviral medicines or a vaccine.\n\nRead the latest [Vermont COVID-19 modeling projections](https://dfr.vermont.gov/about-us/covid-19/modeling) from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation.",

Based on the limited information available at this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low.

If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local [community or hospital-connected clinic](https://www.navigateresources.net/211vermont/Subcategory.aspx?;;0;;N;0;276976;Health%20Care,%20Dental%20Care) for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital.\n\nFind out [what to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html) from the CDC and [what to do while you’re waiting for test results](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/HS-ID-COVID19-Waiting-For-Test-Results-Handout.pdf).\n\n**Pop-up Testing Sites and Pharmacy Testing Locations**\n\nAny person without symptoms who lives or works in Vermont can be tested at no cost at a pop-up testing site without a doctor’s referral. This includes people who live in a neighboring state and work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Children under 12 months cannot be tested at a pop-up testing site. Please talk to your child’s doctor about testing options. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration.\n\nSome pharmacies may offer testing at no cost for people without symptoms. Call the pharmacy first to see if testing is offered and to schedule an appointment.\n\n[Register for a pop-up testing site](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/resources#testing).\n\nFor pop-up testing site registration questions and issues, call 802-828-2828. If you need transportation to a pop-up testing site, please call 833-387-7200 at least two days before your scheduled appointment.\n\nThe test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past.\n\nFind answers to more [frequently asked questions about pop-up testing sites](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Pop-up-Testing-FAQs.pdf).\n\nSome commercial businesses may offer other testing opportunities.

In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the test’s effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nWe will continue to use public health best practice – considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level – to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nAntibody testing that has been performed in Vermont, up to now, has been conducted on a trial basis and limited to specific groups such as health care workers.",

We recognized the need to include this information to help us understand how Vermonters were being affected by COVID-19, but in our earlier efforts to respond to the pandemic, race and ethnicity data was not always collected for each patient. A [Weekly Summary of Vermont COVID-19 Data](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Weekly-Summary-of-Data.pdf) is also available that includes more details on who has been impacted by COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nHealth equity exists when all people have a fair and just opportunity to be healthy – especially those who have experienced socioeconomic disadvantage, historical injustice, and other systemic inequalities. Therefore, our epidemiology team collaborated with Vermont Information Technology Leaders (VITL) to cross-reference medical records to gain more robust race information about COVID-19 cases in Vermont.\n\nWe can use this data to help to prevent the spread of illness, improve care for patients, and present a more complete picture of how COVID-19 may be affecting everyone in Vermont.",

Finding people who are close contacts to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, and therefore at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, can help prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nA team of callers tries to reach anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe – to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) Those contacts might include family members, co-workers or health care providers. **Please note, the Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a “robo” (computer-generated voice) call.**\n\nThe team then gets in touch with those contacts and provides health guidance on [what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf). A close contact is asked to stay home for 14 days and watch for symptoms.\n\nWhile we have been successful in contact tracing, we will continue to add resources and personnel needed to address any increase in the number of people who test positive, which we expect to happen with more testing. This includes the use of technology to help in these efforts.\n\nWe are now offering [enrollment in Sara Alert](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/EpiInfoWebSurvey/Home/9c2e5941-1ba7-4ab4-84be-558ba7684f5d) – a free, automated and secure reminder system to check for [common symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19). People who have tested positive for COVID-19, their close contacts, and people traveling or returning to Vermont, can quickly and easily sign up to receive free daily reminders to check themselves for symptoms by email, text or phone call. If symptoms are reported, a member of our team will reach out to provide guidance and next steps. Sara Alert helps our public health teams contain the spread of COVID-19. [Sign up for Sara Alert](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/EpiInfoWebSurvey/Home/9c2e5941-1ba7-4ab4-84be-558ba7684f5d).\n\nPlease note, Sara Alert is not a contact tracing system. It is not GPS based, so it does not monitor your movements.\n\nAs the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.",

A new Testing and Tracing Task Force has been created to guide and oversee this process.\n\nTesting is currently available for:\n\n*   Any adult or child with symptoms of COVID-19 – even if their symptoms are mild – who has been referred for testing by their doctor.\n*   Long-term care facilities and other group living settings:\n    *   All residents and staff in group living settings, where there has been a single positive test. This includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities, prisons, and certain high-density residential buildings.\n    *   If there is a person who has tested positive with COVID-19 at a skilled nursing facility, they can be retested at 3 days, 7 days, 10 days and 14 days after the initial test. This is to help prevent community-wide outbreaks.\n    *   For all sites, regardless of whether a person has tested positive, testing is offered at intake, discharge, and for certain residents who require regular care outside of the facility.\n*   Staff at correctional facilities\n*   Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a [pop-up testing site](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/resources#testing) without a doctor’s referral, but registration for testing is required. Regular test collection locations still require a doctor’s referral.\n*   Anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine can be tested.

This is so we can see if the case numbers start to grow again as the state reopens. In Vermont, to achieve that rate, we need to test about 1,000 people per day.\n\nAs we test more and more people without symptoms, we are finding fewer and fewer cases. Early on, we only tested people who were very, very ill. Even then, a vast majority did not have COVID-19. Over time we started to test people who were moderately ill, then with mild symptoms, and now we also can include people who do not have symptoms.\n\nTesting helps us better understand the current rate of active infections of COVID-19 in Vermont, and helps to contain and slow the spread to others.
