Symptoms may start 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4°F or greater)\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Chills\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\n**Not everyone with COVID-19 has a fever. Even mild symptoms** (like a headache or dry cough) could be signs of COVID-19. All Vermonters, even with mild symptoms, are encouraged to contact their health care provider to get tested. Your provider will test you at their office or refer you for testing nearby. Stay home while waiting for your result.\n\nIf you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nLearn more about what to do [if you have COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/if-you-have-covid-19).",

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses.\n\nOne important difference between COVID-19 and the flu is that we have a vaccine for the flu!\n\nIt’s more important than ever to get your flu shot this year, when flu viruses and the new coronavirus may be spreading at the same time. [Learn more about the flu and find a flu shot](https://www.healthvermont.gov/immunizations-infectious-disease/influenza/prevention).\n\nBecause some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two:\n\n*   COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people.\n*   It can take longer before people show symptoms of COVID-19, and people can be contagious with the COVID-19 virus for longer.\n\nDoctors and scientists are working to estimate the death rate of COVID-19, but currently, it is thought to be substantially higher (possibly 10 times or more) than that of most strains of the flu.\n\nFind more information about the [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) from the CDC.\n\nThere are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading the flu and COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).",

When will a vaccine be available?**\n\nThere is no vaccine for COVID-19, but research and work are underway to develop one.\n\nThe Health Department is keeping a close watch on the vaccine development process to be sure we can trust that that science governs the process. The pressure to get a vaccine quickly must not outweigh the importance of its safety and efficacy.\n\nWe stand together with other health departments across the country, as well as the national Association of Immunization Managers, in our insistence that any vaccine made available to the public must first meet all Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety standards, and be recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent national advisory committee.\n\nFind out more about what Vermont is doing to [prepare for a COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/vermont-covid-19-vaccine-planning).\n\nWhile we wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Health Department strongly recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get their flu shot. The flu vaccine is available in your doctor’s office and at pharmacies around the state. This will help prevent the potential harm of getting the flu and COVID-19 – at the same time or in succession.

            "answer": "**How does COVID-19 spread?**\n\n**COVID-19 most commonly spreads during close contact through respiratory droplets**\n\nCOVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are near each other (within about 6 feet).\n\nWhen people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe they produce respiratory droplets. Another person can become infected if they inhale the droplets, or if droplets land in their nose or mouth.\n\n**COVID-19 can sometimes spread through airborne transmission**\n\nAs the respiratory droplets travel further from the person with COVID-19, the concentration of these droplets decreases. Larger droplets fall out of the air due to gravity. Smaller droplets and particles spread apart in the air.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away.\n\nThis airborne transmission is uncommon, but has occurred in situations such as indoors when a person with COVID-19 had symptoms and been coughing for longer than 30 minutes. Other examples include shouting, singing or exercising, or being in a [building without proper ventilation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) that allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\n**COVID-19 spreads less commonly through contact with contaminated surfaces**\n\nRespiratory droplets can also land on surfaces and objects. It is possible that a person could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or eyes, but this is **not** thought to be a common way that COVID-19 spreads. This can be prevented by washing your hands before you touch your face, mouth or eyes.\n\nNot everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19), and learn more from the CDC about [how to protect yourself and others from getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).",

How can I help my children from getting sick?**\n\nNo. Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/MIS-C-Fact-Sheet.pdf). Currently, information about MIS-C is limited, and the CDC is working to learn more.\n\nYou can teach your children to do the same things everyone can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\nSocializing for children is important for their development and wellbeing.

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks), group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes), and other places where it’s not possible to stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nFace masks or coverings are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also not required for – and should not be worn by:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance\n*   Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask\n\nIf you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.\n\nBusinesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).\n\nIn private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering anytime you’re around people you don’t live with.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, these are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [How to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

Generally, these are people you were within 6 feet of, for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period, during the [time they were infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734) (contagious).\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2020/10/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home.\n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that [you are a close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19) of someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer. \n\n**If you are** _**not**_ **identified as a close contact**, then you will not be called. While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and get tested on day 7 or after if you have not had any symptoms.\n\nIf you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to follow the prevention steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

This includes all inside and outside social, recreational and entertainment gatherings, and in public and private spaces. [Learn more about what this means](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\nYou can prevent the spread of COVID-19 by following these general [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19):\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small. At this time, your social circle should only include the people you live with.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask (children over 2 who are able) anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nIf you are around other people, it’s safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19.\n\nGathering in groups or “pods” related to education or child care that are already formed can continue. Gathering in pods related to social activity, informal playgroups, playdates, or sleepovers are not allowed at this time. New pods of any kind are discouraged. Find more guidance related to [limits on multi-household social gatherings](https://education.vermont.gov/sites/aoe/files/documents/edu-guidance-for-schools-related-to-limits-on-multi-household-social-gatherings.pdf) and more [frequently asked questions from the Agency of Education](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/faq-guidance-for-schools-related-to-limits-on-multi-household-gatherings).\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nChildren can also continue to take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends and family. These changes will continue to be difficult, but we are all doing our part to slow down this pandemic.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Resources for families with children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/families-children)\n*   [Coping with family stress during COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/coping-stress)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [Frequently asked questions about school](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#families-with-children-school)",

Data to date show that a person who has had and recovered from COVID-19 may have low levels of virus in their bodies for up to three months after diagnosis. This means that if the person who has recovered from COVID-19 is retested within three months of initial infection, they may continue to have a positive test result, even though they are not spreading COVID-19.\n\nThere are no confirmed reports to date of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within three months of initial infection. However, additional research is ongoing. Therefore, if a person who has recovered from COVID-19 has new symptoms of COVID-19, the person may need an evaluation for reinfection, especially if the person has had close contact with someone infected with COVID-19. The person should isolate and contact a health care provider to be evaluated for other causes of their symptoms, and possibly retested.",

Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days.

Your cloth face mask or covering should include multiple layers of fabric and allow you to be able to breathe easily. Watch a quick [video by the CDC on how to make your own cloth face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html).\n\nYou are required to wear a face mask or covering in public spaces in Vermont. This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks), group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes), and other places where it’s not possible to stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nIn private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering anytime you're around people you don’t live with.\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [How to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

If you think you should be tested for COVID-19, talk with your health care provider. If you don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nThe Health Department recommends testing **as soon as possible** when:\n\n*   you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms).\n*   you are referred by your health care provider.\n*   a person in your workplace or household, or a person you attended an event with, tests positive for COVID-19.\n*   you plan on going to a social gathering with people you don't live with (other than recreating with one masked person outside). You should get tested before the gathering, right after, and again on day 7.\n\nIf you often gather socially with people you don't live with, you should get tested weekly.\n\n**College students **returning to Vermont from out of state should quarantine and be tested on or after day 7 of quarantine after returning home.\n\n**Travelers to Vermont** and **Vermonters returning from out of state **must follow [quarantine requirements](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/travel-quarantine).

We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.\n\nIf a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time [while the person was infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.\n\nVermont is taking additional measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities. This includes nursing homes, corrections facilities, residential homes for those with disabilities, residential treatment centers, assisted living facilities, state psychiatric care facilities, and homeless shelters. If a staff member or resident tests positive for COVID-19, universal testing of all staff and residents is offered at these facilities. Staff and residents may decline testing, and facilities may decline universal testing. Additionally, when a person tests positive at a skilled nursing facility, sequential testing (additional testing on following days) is offered to those who tested negative during the universal testing.\n\nThe Health Department also recommends [surveillance testing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-LTCFSurveillanceTesting.pdf) at long-term care facilities to identify people with COVID-19 and to help stop outbreaks in long-term care facilities.\n\nResidents and staff of group living facilities and new admissions to nursing homes, assisted living residences, and residential care homes must complete the full 14-day quarantine period first.",

In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nThe CDC is working with commercial laboratories to [estimate the percentage of people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) who were infected with the COVID-19 virus.

This includes all inside and outside social, recreational and entertainment gatherings, and in public and private spaces as well as any gatherings that are incidental to ceremonies, parties and celebrations. This means that visitors to Vermont can only socialize with the people they are traveling with. They cannot gather with Vermonters or with people from another traveling group. [Learn more about what this means](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\nFind up-to-date [information on wedding ceremonies](https://accd.vermont.gov/news/update-new-work-safe-additions-be-smart-stay-safe-order#event-venues), including the number of people that are allowed, from the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.\n\nIf you or your guests are visiting Vermont, you must [quarantine for 14 days](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4615) before engaging in any activities. You must also follow the Governor’s [Be Smart, Stay Safe](https://governor.vermont.gov/document-types/executive-orders) Order.\n\nIf you have not had [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), you have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end your quarantine with a negative test result. You must remain in quarantine until you travel to Vermont.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nWhenever possible, keep ceremonies outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19.\n\nFind more [travel and quarantine information](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/travel-quarantine/visitors-vermont) and answers to [frequently asked questions about travel](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#travel).",

It’s also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others.\n\n**If you test positive for COVID-19**, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** you will be contacted. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time.

Soon you will receive a call from a Health Department Contact Tracer.\n\n**It’s important to answer the call** and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus. Governor Scott’s [Executive Order](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%208%20TO%20AMENDED%20AND%20RESTATED%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) calls on Vermonters to comply with all contact tracing requests.\n\nAll restaurants and other businesses are keeping a 30-day log of employee and guest names and contact information in case contact tracing is needed.\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nCurrently, Vermont is not participating in the contact tracing notifications that are available on some cell phones. We are waiting to see how successful this service is in other states who are participating. If it’s proven to be effective, we will consider using it.\n\nLearn how [contact tracing for COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) works in Vermont.",

This includes all inside and outside social, recreational and entertainment gatherings, and in public and private spaces. [Learn more about what this means](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n\nYou can prevent the spread of COVID-19 by following these general [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19):\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nIf you are around other people, it’s safest to be outdoors. Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19.\n\nIf you do gather with another household, you should quarantine. Quarantine means staying home and away from other people for 14 days.\n\nWe advise you to get tested as soon as possible after the gathering and then again on day 7. If you have not had [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), you have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end your quarantine with a negative test result. You have the same option if you traveled.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nAlso, consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nThe risk for severe illness increases with age and is higher for older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions. They should consider [taking additional steps to limit their risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4559), stay close to home, and family and friends should do everything they can to help keep them safe.\n\n**Learn more**:\n\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) from the CDC",

According to the CDC, it is currently thought that the risk of getting COVID-19 from properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is low. There has been no evidence that a person can get COVID-19 by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large rainstorms during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rainstorms, and do not swallow the water. \n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, plan to “arrive, play, and leave” — avoiding gathering before and after activities and giving others space. Follow these steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask any time you’re not in the water and can’t keep 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [healthy swimming](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/index.html) from the CDC.",

We do not yet know what causes MIS-C. However, we know that many children with MIS-C had the COVID-19 virus, or had been around someone with COVID-19. Children with MIS-C may have a fever and various symptoms, including abdominal (gut) pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or feeling extra tired. MIS-C can be serious, even deadly, but most children who were diagnosed with this condition have gotten better with medical care.\n\nMIS-C is rare, and it remains unknown whether multisystem inflammatory syndrome only occurs in children or if it also can occur in adults.\n\nLearn more about [Multisystem Inflammatory Disease and COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/MIS-C-Fact-Sheet.pdf) from the Health Department.",

Face shields are generally not recommended because they are more for health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in. However, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a cloth face mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier on your nose and mouth.\n\nOutdoor workers who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a face mask or covering when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people). It is important that workers keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when they are not wearing a mask.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece. Clean them regularly – especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield – [handle them like face masks or coverings](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4723) when putting them on or removing them.",

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671) (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nThough antigen tests may be available in Vermont, the Health Department only recommends antigen testing in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n\nWhen used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests are different from [antibody (serologic) tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4654), which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Use of Antigen Testing in Vermont – Health Update October 1, 2020](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-AntigenTesting.pdf)\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food and Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

This is why there is the option for people to be tested on day 7 or after in their quarantine and, if the test is negative, to end quarantine. The test must be a PCR test.\n\nThe CDC has released [new options to shorten quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-options-to-reduce-quarantine.html). These options allow state and local public health authorities to determine and establish the quarantine options for their jurisdictions. \n\nAt this time, there are no plans to change Vermont's existing policy, which calls for a 14-day quarantine, or gives the option to get a PCR test on day 7 or later to end quarantine early with a negative test, as long as the person continues to have no symptoms. \n\nThis policy, implemented in May, is well-understood by Vermonters and our data show it has worked to prevent further spread of COVID-19. \n\nWe will continue to review our guidance regularly to make sure we are using best practices based on data and science throughout the pandemic.",

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks), group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes), and other places where it’s not possible to stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nIn private settings (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering anytime you're around people you don’t live with.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, do these things to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19: stay home if you are sick, wash your hands often, keep your social circle small, and stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n\nA face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n*   Wash your hands before putting it on.\n*   Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n*   Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n*   Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n*   Keep it on until you get home.\n*   Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n*   Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nIf you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot outside, you should take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you stay at least 6 feet away from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [How to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

Employers can keep employees safe by following [prevention guidance](https://accd.vermont.gov/news/update-new-work-safe-additions-be-smart-stay-safe-order) in their work place.\n\nIf you are under quarantine and have had no symptoms, you have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) to end quarantine early. If your test is negative and you still have no symptoms, you can return to work.\n\nThe Health Department does **not** issue letters for employees to return to work either.\n\nThe best way to know when it’s safe for someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to return to work is to follow guidance based on the presence of symptoms, or the amount of time that has passed since the person was tested.

In private settings, we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering anytime you're around people you don’t live with. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537), by respiratory droplets released when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.\n\nIf you have trouble breathing or if you work in a setting where it is difficult to wear a face mask or covering, wearing a face shield is better than wearing nothing over your nose and mouth. People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom. In [school settings](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/guidance-strong-healthy-start-health-guidance), students and adults are allowed to wear face shields, and in [child care settings](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Health-Guidance-Childcare-Summer-Programs.pdf), providers, teachers and staff are allowed to wear face shields.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece. Clean them regularly – especially if condensation or droplets are visible on the inside of the shield – [handle them like face masks or coverings](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4723) when putting them on or removing them.",

            "answer": "**Is it safe to send my children back to school or child care?**\n\nYes, based on current data and levels of the COVID-19 virus in Vermont, it is safe – and important – for children to go to school or child care for in-person learning. On July 27, the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics asked schools to prioritize in-person attendance for preschool to grade 5, and for students with special needs.\n\nWe know much more about the virus now than we did in March when schools closed for the spring. The Health Department can track data in real-time and respond to cases quickly with our contact tracing teams. We also have robust testing and [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) system in Vermont that will support schools in containing the virus if there is a case.\n\nChildren need structure, relationships with their peers, teachers, and other adults for their academic, social, and emotional development. Although remote learning is an important tool during the pandemic, it can lead to even greater gaps in equity. Public health and education experts considered all these factors when writing Vermont’s guidance to reopen schools, which focuses on the safety of teachers, staff, and students.\n\nWe are seeing more cases of COVID-19 in children nationwide and in Vermont, but that is not surprising as states have reopened, and more testing has become available.\n\nWe recognize there may be cases in schools as they reopen. This is why Vermont’s reopening guidance outlines ways to keep the virus out of schools and prevent it from spreading through physical distancing, face masks or coverings, hand hygiene, and contact tracing.\n\nLearn more about [what parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf) as schools reopen for the fall.",

At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl in them, an opioid. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\n**If you are alone:**\n\n*   Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them you’re going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they don’t hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.\n*   Call [Never Use Alone](http://neverusealone.com/) at 800-648-3570 or message them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Neverusealone/). They’ll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you don’t respond after a certain period of time.\n*   Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**If you’re not alone:**\n\n*   Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people you’re with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household don’t need to stay 6 feet apart.\n*   Anyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.\n*   Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they aren’t using at the moment.\n*   Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:**\n\n*   Use one drug at a time (don’t mix).\n*   Know your tolerance. Use less if you haven’t used in a while, or if you’ve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\n*   Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\n*   Start low and go slow. You can use more later.\n*   Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\n*   Consider getting on medication-assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\n*   Call 802-565-LINK or go to [VTHelplink](https://vthelplink.org/app/account/opa_result) to find a treatment center.\n\n**About wearing face masks or coverings:**\n\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you can’t take your own mask off (like if you’re nodding out), you shouldn’t wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.\n\n**More information:**\n\n*   [Tips to prevent an opioid overdose](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   [Helping during an overdose and finding Naloxone](https://www.healthvermont.gov/emergency/injury/opioid-overdose-prevention) (Health Department)\n*   [Guidance for People Who Use Substances on COVID-19](https://yale.app.box.com/v/COVID19HarmReductionGuidance) (Yale)\n*   [Safer Drug Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak](https://harmreduction.org/miscellaneous/covid-19-guidance-for-people-who-use-drugs-and-harm-reduction-programs/?utm_source=all+IRETA+communications&utm_campaign=c611c175b0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_16_01_32&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5cec8dc768-c611c175b0-137425257&mc_cid=c611c175b0&mc_eid=7bcfbcf675) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   Find a [syringe service program](https://www.healthvermont.gov/disease-control/hiv-std-hepatitis-community-resources/syringe-service-programs) near you.

Schools are encouraged to call the Health Department when learning of a positive test result. \n\nThe Health Department will:\n\n*   Contact the person who tested positive (or their parent/guardian), ask them questions about their recent activities and who they’ve been in [close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) with, and give instructions on staying home.\n*   Notify the school if the person who tested positive is associated with a school. \n*   Schools do not need to take action if the Health Department determines that there is no risk of further spread at the school. For example, if the person with COVID-19 was not at school during their infectious period, there would not have been an opportunity to spread the virus to others at school. \n*   Work closely with the school to identify close contacts at school (within 6 feet for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) of the person who tested positive with COVID-19 during their [infectious period](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).\n*   Discuss next steps with school administration, including whether to temporarily close the classroom for in-person instruction. These decisions are made on a case by case basis. The Health Department will provide guidance based on a number of factors, including the level of community transmission, the number of students or staff infected, the status of contact tracing, the number of days the infectious person was at school, infection control policies and practices, the number and structure of classes, pods, or grades affected, and other opportunities for transmission, like extra-curricular activities.\n\nThe school will:\n\n*   Close off any areas where the person spent longer than 15 minutes (like a classroom, gym, or a cafeteria) then clean and disinfect the areas.\n*   Communicate with parents and staff about the situation.\n*   Support the Health Department’s efforts by notifying people associated with the school who have been identified as [close contacts](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4575). The school will provide them with Health Department guidance and information on quarantine and testing. [Quarantine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#isolation-quarantine-and-selfobservation-quarantine) means staying home and away from other people for up to 14 days. \n*   Make sure that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 stays home from school [(isolation)](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#isolation-quarantine-and-selfobservation-isolation) until they can return.

            "answer": "**How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?**\n\nBecause of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\n\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you don’t live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\n*   **How big the space is** – Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\n*   **How many people are in the room or area** – A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\n*   **How much ventilation there is** – Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. If it is too cold outside to open windows, then setting up a fan to pull air out of the room can reduce your risk. However, using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\n*   **How humid the room or area is** - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you can, run a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40% in the room or area where people are gathering.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask anytime you are around people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) from the CDC",

Using “I” instead of “you” statements helps people avoid feeling defensive or judged. In fact, blaming and shaming may actually increase push back and the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors. We recommend sharing what you’re comfortable with based on your own perspective instead of making demands of others.\n3.  **Share why it is important to you**. Share what level of risk works for you and why. It might be different for others. Some people feel comfortable taking on a moderate amount of risk in their lives. Others may not feel comfortable taking on any risk. Focusing on your own reasons for staying safe can help people to better understand and get on board.\n4.  **Set boundaries and stick to them**. We are all for keeping it friendly, open and non-judgmental – but that doesn’t mean you have to skimp on your safety! It’s OK to be clear and straightforward with what you need to feel safe and comfortable. It’s also okay to decline invitations or leave situations that feel too risky. You should never have to feel bad or apologize for prioritizing your safety. Lead by example by sticking to what works for you and avoiding judgment.\n\nFind some [examples of the “COVID Talk”](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/tips-you-get-together).",

But as cases of COVID-19 surge in Vermont, we need to do everything we can to stop the spread.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\n*   You are not allowed to gather with people you don’t live with. This includes gathering both inside and outside, and in public and private spaces. [Learn more about what this means](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4761).\n*   Visitors to Vermont cannot gather with Vermonters in their home or elsewhere.\n*   The Health Department strongly advises against travel right now, even within Vermont. All travel to and from Vermont requires quarantine (unless it’s considered [essential travel](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4637)).\n\nIf you do gather with another household for the holidays or any other time, you should quarantine. Quarantine means staying home and away from other people for 14 days.\n\nWe advise you to get tested as soon as possible after the gathering and then again on day 7. If you have not had [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), you have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end your quarantine with a negative test result. You have the same option if you traveled.\n\nAny time you are around others, remember to add these things: 6-Foot Spaces, Masks on Faces, Uncrowded Places. Imagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. The more layers there are, the safer everyone will be. Learn more about [COVID-19 prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nRemember, the virus can spread easily among family and friends — because they are the ones we are often in close contact with — when they don’t know they have it. Like other aspects of our lives, this holiday season will look different and we need to do everything we can to keep each other safe.\n\n**Find more tips from the CDC:**\n\n*   [Holiday celebrations and small gatherings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html)\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings)\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event)",

            "answer": "**Why are social gatherings prohibited right now?**\n\nVermont is seeing a surge in new COVID-19 cases. Recent data have shown that social gatherings, both inside and outside, at homes, bars and social clubs, and among sports teams are currently driving outbreaks in Vermont. This is why there are restrictions on social gatherings at this time.\n\nThis is what you **cannot** do:\n\n*   You are not allowed to gather with people you don’t live with. This includes all inside and outside social, recreational and entertainment gatherings, and in public and private spaces. For example, this means you cannot go over to a family member or friend’s house or go to a restaurant with someone you don’t live with.\n*   Visitors to Vermont cannot gather with Vermonters or with people from another traveling group. This includes sharing lodging with another household or traveling group. Travelers may not stay with a Vermont host or stay in a Vermont lodging establishment or short-term rental with another household. Even if they have completed a quarantine, or intend to quarantine with another household, they may not gather with another household in Vermont.\n\nThis is what you **can** do:\n\n*   People who live alone may gather with people who live in one other household.\n*   People can take in and shelter those from another household who are living in a dangerous, unhealthy or otherwise unsafe situation.\n*   You can do outdoor fitness activities with one other person from another household. However, both of you must stay at least 6 feet away from each other and wear a mask at all times. For example, you can bike, hike, walk or run with one of your neighbors.\n*   Visitors to Vermont can socialize only with the people they are traveling with.\n\nIt is not considered a social gathering if you have contact with someone for less than 15 minutes, you both are wearing masks, and you stay at least 6 feet apart (for example, checking on a neighbor, friend or family member not in your household). You are allowed to come in contact with members of other households in settings that continue to operate – such as schools, workplaces, retail stores, close contact businesses, etc. – as long as all the required health protocols are followed.\n\nVermont data at this time does not point to dining at restaurants, gyms, or other close contact businesses as drivers of outbreaks, and current safety protocols at these businesses are working. This is why they are remaining open.\n\nWe must all do our part to slow the spread, ensure hospitals are not overwhelmed, help schools continue to offer in-person instruction, and keep as many Vermonters working as possible.\n\nWe know this is difficult, but hope that as Vermonters follow this guidance, and we can return to the low case numbers we had and ease restrictions once again.\n\nRead Governor Scott’s [Executive Order](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-8-amended-and-restated-executive-order-01-20-0).",

For example, if a person depends on someone who is under quarantine for care and basic needs, and close contact cannot be avoided, the person who receives care may continue with activities outside of the home.

Since then, the Health Department has tracked probable cases and taken the same public health actions as if they were a confirmed case (confirmed means the person tested positive on a PCR test).\n\nThis means that contact tracers conduct interviews with people who are considered probable cases, provide isolation guidance, and their close contacts are notified to quarantine. People who are considered probable cases are also encouraged to get a follow-up PCR test. If they test positive on a follow-up PCR test, they are only included once in the total case count.\n\nThe Health Department began including probable cases in case counts to more accurately represent COVID-19 activity and because antigen testing in Vermont is increasing. The impact on the total case count is minimal. At this time, about 120 cases, or 2.8%, of total cases are probable cases.
