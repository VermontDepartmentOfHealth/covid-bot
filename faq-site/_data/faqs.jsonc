Symptoms may start 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4°F or greater)\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Chills\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\n**Get medical care immediately** if you have trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or changes in color on your lips, gums, face, around the eyes, or nails.\n\n**Not everyone with COVID-19 has a fever. Even mild symptoms** (like a headache or dry cough) could be signs of COVID-19.\n\n**Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms**. People with COVID-19 who don't have any symptoms can spread the virus to other people. Learn [how to protect yourself and others](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others).\n\n**If you have symptoms, even mild ones, contact your health care provider to get tested**, even if you are vaccinated or had COVID-19. Your provider will test you at their office or refer you for testing nearby. Stay home while waiting for your result.\n\n**If you do not have a health care provider**, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nLearn more about what to do [if you have COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/if-you-have-covid-19).\n\nFind information about the [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) from the CDC.",

Where can I get tested?**\n\nThere are a variety of testing options available to you: your health care provider, pharmacies and Health Department testing sites. You can make an appointment or just walk in. Testing is free to all, and many sites now let you [take your own sample](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/what-expect) using a short swab in your nose.\n\n[**Find out where to get tested**](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/where-get-tested).\n\nAnyone can get tested at a Health Department testing site if they do not have symptoms. This includes children 12 months or older, people who work in Vermont, visitors to Vermont and international travelers. Infants under 12 months can get tested at their health care provider’s office. Anyone under 18 should be accompanied by a parent or guardian or bring a signed parental consent form.\n\nThe Health Department uses and recommends [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671). You can get other tests, like at-home or saliva tests. However, if you are testing out of quarantine early, the test must be for a current infection (like a PCR test), except it cannot be an antigen test (also known as a rapid test).\n\nIf you have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), **do not go to a testing site**. Talk to your health care provider about getting tested.\n\nIf you or your child don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/). If you are visiting Vermont or are an international traveler, you will need to contact your primary care provider or call Vermont 2-1-1 if you do not have a provider.\n\nThe Health Department recommends testing **as soon as possible** when:\n\n*   You have [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), whether or not you are fully vaccinated or previously had COVID-19. Call your health care provider first.\n*   You are referred by your health care provider.\n*   You are not fully vaccinated and a person in your workplace or household, or a person you attended an event with, tests positive for COVID-19.\n\nYou may come to a Health Department testing site to get **tested more than once** if you have reason to be concerned about infection.\n\nIf you need a **ride to the testing site**, schedule your appointment first, and then call 833-387-7200 at least two days before the appointment.\n\n**Find out:**\n\n*   [Where to get tested and how to **schedule an appointment**](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/where-get-tested)\n*   [**What to expect** at a Health Department testing site](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/testing/what-expect) – including answers to **more questions about testing**\n*   [What to do **while you’re waiting** for test results](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Waiting-For-Test-Results-English.pdf)\n*   [When you will get your **test results**](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4547)\n*   [What the different **types of tests** are](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#testing-types-of-tests)\n*   [How many Vermonters have been tested](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/current-activity/vermont-dashboard) – this information is updated daily.",

They will contact you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a [certain amount of time](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/COVID19-timeline-close-contacts.png). They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home. \n\nIf you receive a text message from 89361, this is a notification from the Health Department that you are a close contact of someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

It starts two days before any symptoms began and continues [until they are recovered](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601). For people who haven’t had symptoms, it starts two days before they had a positive test.\n\nClose contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a short period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**\n\n*   You live in the same home.\n*   You are intimate partners.\n*   You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.\n*   You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** _**not**_ **close contacts:**\n\n*   You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n*   You were their server at a restaurant.\n*   You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n*   You were in front of the person in line at the store.\n*   You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact**, you will be contacted. Learn more about [when you are a close contact to someone with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/you-are-close-contact-someone-covid-19).\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day.

You can get other tests, like at-home or saliva tests. However, if you are testing out of quarantine early, the test must be for a current infection (like a PCR test), except it cannot be an antigen test (also known as a rapid test).",

What do I need to know, and how can I help keep my children safe from COVID-19?**\n\nAs of June 14, there are no COVID-19 restrictions or requirements for Vermonters or visitors to follow.\n\nWith Vermont’s high vaccination rates and low number COVID-19 cases, it’s safe for most Vermonters to return to the activities they did before the pandemic. Our high vaccination rates mean the vast majority of Vermonters are protected from the virus, and keep the virus from spreading to others.\n\nEven though more than 80% of eligible Vermonters are vaccinated, there are still some people who cannot get vaccinated. We need to continue to do all we can to help protect children under the age of 12 and people who are not able to get the vaccine due to a weakened immune system or other health condition – particularly if you are unvaccinated.\n\n**Vaccination**\n\nVermont is vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds, following the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in this age group. Learn more about [vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccines-vermont#vaccinesforchildren).\n\nLearn more about [why younger children can’t get vaccinated yet](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4804), and [how to make an appointment for 12- and 17-year-olds](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4849).\n\n**Testing**\n\nChildren 12 months or older can get tested at a Health Department testing site if they do not have symptoms. Infants under 12 months can get tested at their health care provider’s office. Anyone under 18 should be accompanied by a parent or guardian or bring a signed parental consent form. Learn more about [getting tested for COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4545).\n\nIf your child has [symptoms of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/symptoms), **do not go to a testing site**. Talk to their health care provider about getting tested. If your child doesn't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\n**Prevention**\n\nIf you or your children are unvaccinated or only had your first dose, you can choose to follow the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others) to reduce the risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\n**Masks**\n\nBecause a COVID-19 vaccine is not currently available for children under 12 years old, there are a large number of unvaccinated people at schools, child care and summer camps. The Health Department recommends that unvaccinated people 2 years and older wear masks when inside at schools, child care and summer camps this summer.\n\n**Social Gatherings**\n\nIf you or your children are unvaccinated or only had your first dose, continue to take care when getting together with friends and family or when you are in a crowd. If you are at an indoor gathering or event, wearing a mask and staying 6 feet apart helps protect anyone who is unvaccinated, at [increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html), or lives with someone who is at increased risk.\n\n**Travel**\n\nThe CDC recommends delaying travel until you are fully vaccinated, because travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19.\n\nExcept for [international travel](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4568), travel no longer requires testing or quarantine.\n\nFederal regulations require everyone to [wear masks when using public transportation](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html), including school buses.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Resources for families with children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/families-children)\n*   [Coping with family stress during COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/coping-stress)\n*   [COVID-19 in children and teens](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/symptoms.html) from the CDC\n*   [Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/mis-c/) from the CDC",

This helps to prevent the spread of COVID-19 before a person knows they are sick, or if they are infected with the virus and don’t have symptoms.\n\nQuarantine is for people who were in [close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4575) with someone with COVID-19 ([unless you are fully vaccinated](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4825) or [recently had COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4820)). Day 1 of your quarantine starts the day after you were last in contact with them.\n\n**Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days**. This means you can’t do any activities outside of your home, like going to school, work, or out to do errands. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms. Call your health care provider if you start to feel sick. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nYou are allowed to go outside for a walk or a bike ride while you are in quarantine only if:\n\n*   you do not have any symptoms,\n*   you are alone,\n*   you wear a mask at all times,\n*   you are in an uncrowded place, **and**\n*   you can stay at least 6 feet from other people at all times.\n\nFor example, you can go for a walk or bike ride in your neighborhood. You should not go for a walk or bike ride on a bike path, on busy hiking or biking trails, or in a downtown area.\n\n**You can end quarantine early** if you get tested on or after day 7 of your quarantine and get a negative test result. You must not have had any symptoms of COVID-19, and must continue to monitor yourself for symptoms for the full 14 days.

The testing measures the body’s immune response to the virus. It does not detect the virus itself.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nThe CDC is working with commercial laboratories to [estimate the percentage of people](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/commercial-lab-surveys.html) who were infected with the COVID-19 virus.

These options allow state and local public health authorities to determine and establish the quarantine options for their jurisdictions.\n\nAt this time, there are no plans to change Vermont's existing policy, which calls for a 14-day quarantine, or gives the option to get tested on day 7 or later to end quarantine early with a negative test, as long as the person continues to have no symptoms.\n\nThis policy, implemented in May 2020, is well-understood by Vermonters and our data show it has worked to prevent further spread of COVID-19. Read the [article in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7001a3.htm?s_cid=mm7001a3_w) to learn more.\n\nWe will continue to review our guidance regularly to make sure we are using best practices based on data and science throughout the pandemic.",

Have a few on hand so you can rotate them for washing and have enough clean ones to wear.\n\n**During hot weather**, if you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot, take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. \n\n**During cold weather**, change your mask when it becomes wet. Keep a spare mask to replace the wet one, and put the wet one in a plastic bag until you get home. If you need to wear a scarf, ski mask or balaclava, wear it over your mask. If you wear glasses, find a mask that fits closely over your nose or has a nose wire to help reduce fogging.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [CDC’s guide to masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) – how to choose, wear, store and wash masks",

Masks or coverings, like a cloth mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus. However, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier over your nose and mouth.\n\nIf you choose to wear a face shield, make sure it fits properly. Face shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

            "answer": "**How does being indoors with the windows closed affect my risk of getting COVID-19?**\n\nBecause of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of getting or spreading COVID-19.\n\n[COVID-19 spreads](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) when a person infected with COVID-19 breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus when they cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe. \n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne. These small particles can infect someone who is more than 6 feet away. This airborne transmission is uncommon, but can happen when inside a building without proper ventilation that has allowed a buildup of respiratory droplets or particles.\n\nIn general, the more people there are in an indoor environment, the more there is a need for ventilation with outdoor air.\n\nThere is going to be some level of risk if you are indoors with people you don’t live with. The level of risk can depend on multiple things, including:\n\n*   **How big the space is** – Larger rooms or areas that allow enough space for everyone to keep a 6-foot distance from others are less of a risk than small rooms or areas that can easily get crowded.\n*   **How many people are in the room or area** – A small number of people reduces your risk compared to many people who are not able to keep a 6-foot distance from others.\n*   **How much ventilation there is** – Open windows and doors for ventilation with outdoor air. Using a fan to blow air into or around the room or using ceiling fans is not recommended since they could keep the virus in the air for longer.\n*   **How humid the room or area is** - Coronaviruses thrive when the relative humidity is below 40%, which usually happens when buildings are heated during the fall and winter. If you run a dehumidifier, follow all the manufacturer’s instructions to prevent problems, like mold.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nFollow the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [COVID-19 and indoor air](https://youtu.be/-0_zafaEUEM)\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Improving ventilation in your home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/Improving-Ventilation-Home.html) from the CDC\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC",

If you **cannot** avoid [close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4575) with someone with COVID-19, you should quarantine while the person you are caring for is sick. You should also quarantine for 14 days **after** they are able to end [home isolation](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4601).\n\nQuarantine is used to keep someone who might have been exposed to COVID-19 away from other people. Quarantine means you need to stay home and away from other people for 14 days since the day you were potentially exposed. You should separate yourself from others and check yourself for symptoms.

[**Log in to your account**](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration) to make an appointment.\n\nAnyone who is unable to make their appointment online, needs help, or who wants to speak with someone in a language other than English can call **855-722-7878**. This phone line is TTY enabled.\n\nYou can also make an appointment directly through [Kinney Drugs](https://kinneydrugs.com/pharmacy/covid-19/vaccination-scheduling/vt/), [CVS](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine), [Walgreens](https://www.walgreens.com/schedulevaccine), [Northfield Pharmacy](http://www.northfieldpharmacy.com/) or [UVMMC Outpatient Pharmacies](https://www.uvmhealth.org/medcenter/departments-and-programs/pharmacy-services/schedule-your-covid-19-vaccine).\n\n**Create an Account**\n\nYou will need to create an account in our online system first, and then log in to schedule your appointment.\n\nYou will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person.

To request an interpreter, ask one of the public health workers at the site. Some sites, including Burlington and Winooski, will have in-person interpreters based on demand for these services in the area. If you will need an ASL interpreter at the vaccine clinic, you can select “ASL” as your preferred language when you are making an appointment through the Health Department website.\n\nIf you need **physical assistance** getting to your vaccine appointment, you can have one other person come with you. You will both have your temperatures taken and will be asked questions to determine if you have any current COVID-19 symptoms. If either of you do, then the person who has symptoms won’t be allowed to go any further.\n\nYou will both need to wear masks during your appointment. If you do not have one, there will be masks available at the clinic. If you have trouble breathing, are unable to remove your mask by yourself, or have a medical reason for not wearing one, you will not be required to wear a mask.\n\nFind out what to do if [you need a ride to your appointment](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4799).",

You can make an appointment for a family member, someone who lives with you, someone you care for, or a client.\n\nIf you are scheduling an appointment for someone else, we recommend that you create an account, and then sign them up under your account as a “dependent/household member/client.” Below are the step-by-step instructions. You can also watch a [video on how to make an appointment online](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/vaccine/getting-covid-19-vaccine#video) and find [tips for making an appointment](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-MakingVaccineAppointmentTips.Feb2021.final_.pdf).\n\nIf you would like to make an appointment for someone at the same time as your own, you will need to make the appointments individually. Learn more about [making two appointments at the same time](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4805).\n\nAnyone who is unable to make their appointment online, needs help, or who wants to speak with someone in a language other than English can call **855-722-7878** and press 1 for interpretation services, Monday through Friday from 8:15 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 10:00 a.m. – 3:00 p.m. This phone line is TTY enabled.\n\n**1. Create an account.**\n\nFirst, you will need to create an account in our online system. You will need an email address to create an account, and can use the same address for more than one person. Learn more about [what to do if you don’t have an email address](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4811).\n\nIf you already have an account because you were tested for COVID-19 through a Health Department site, you need to use the same account information to schedule an appointment to get a vaccine. The system will not allow you to create a new account if you use an email address that is already in the system.\n\nIf you already have an account, start at the “add a dependent/household member/client” step below.\n\nHere is how you **create an account**:\n\n*   Go to the [COVID-19 Event Portal](https://vermont.force.com/events/s/selfregistration).\n*   Enter your name, phone number, email address, and date of birth.\n*   Click the “create account” button.\n\nAfter you create an account, an email is immediately sent to the email address you entered. You will need to **verify your account** on the COVID-19 Event Portal to make the person’s appointment:\n\n*   Click on the link in the email sent to you to confirm your account.\n*   Enter your Patient ID number.\n*   Enter your email and date of birth.\n*   Create a password.\n*   Review and consent to the Notice of Privacy Practices.\n*   Enter your personal demographic information.\n*   Enter your vaccine eligibility information, including your passcode (if applicable).\n\n**2. Add a dependent/household member/client.**\n\nYou will need to **add them to your account**. You can watch a [video on how to add a dependent to your account](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dpo4NXMO04U&feature=youtu.be). Click on the “Add Dependent/Household Member/Client” button at the top of the screen. After consenting, you will need to enter their personal information:\n\n*   Name\n*   Email address (use your email, the same one used to set up your account)\n*   Phone number\n*   Select how you would like to receive communication and documents from the Health Department.\n*   Date of birth\n*   Address\n*   Enter their vaccine eligibility information, including their passcode (if applicable).\n\nIf the person getting the vaccine does not live in Vermont, the system will ask do they work in Vermont or recently moved to Vermont. If none of these apply, they won’t be able to get vaccinated in Vermont, and should seek a vaccine in the state where they live.\n\n**3. Schedule a vaccine appointment**.\n\nClick the “Schedule Vaccine Appointment” button at the top of the screen and select their name. Select a clinic site location by searching by county and date range.\n\nNext, you will answer a series of medical (see below) and demographic questions as well as questions about any COVID-19 symptoms the person has. You also will be asked to complete a waiver.\n\nFinally, choose an appointment slot from the list of available appointments. Click the “submit” button. You may be redirected to choose a different location and time depending on their vaccine eligibility. Once you make an appointment, you will immediately receive an email confirmation.\n\nThese are the **medical screening questions** asked:\n\n1.  **Have you had a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or any of its components?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a vaccine. They should consider contacting their health care provider if they have questions.\n2.  **Have you had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injectable therapy?** If the answer is yes, then they will be asked to contact their health care provider for a referral to an allergy/immunology specialist who can determine if they can safely receive the vaccine.\n3.  **Are you currently sick with COVID-19 or still in your isolation period following a COVID-19 infection?** If the answer is yes, then they cannot get a COVID-19 vaccine at this time, but can schedule an appointment at a later date.\n4.  **Have you received passive antibody therapy as treatment for COVID-19 in the past 90 days?** If the answer is yes, then they will need to wait for 90 days before scheduling an appointment.\n5.  **Do you have a weakened immune system caused by something such as HIV infection or cancer or do you take immunosuppressive drugs or therapies?** If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.\n6.  **Are you lactating or breastfeeding?** If the answer is yes, they can make an appointment, but they will be advised to talk with their health care provider before getting vaccinated.",

Getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you from severe illness from COVID-19. If you have questions, a conversation with your health care provider might help, but is not required for vaccination.\n\nBased on how these vaccines work in the body (that is, they do not reproduce inside your body’s cells), experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for people who are pregnant, people who are lactating or breastfeeding babies. However, there are currently limited data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnant people. Additionally, there are no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in people who are breastfeeding, the effects of the vaccines on milk production or excretion, or the effects of vaccination on the breastfed baby.\n\nFor more information, watch the video [Sara Asks about the COVID-19 Vaccine](https://youtu.be/Idq1kyVwZHk), which is also [available in other languages](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/resources/multilingual-resources). Learn more from the CDC about [vaccination considerations for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html)\n\nIf you are trying to become pregnant now or want to get pregnant in the future, it is safe for you to get a COVID-19 vaccine. There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 vaccination causes any problems with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta. There is also no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, your menstrual cycle cannot be affected by being near someone who received a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPregnant people with COVID-19 are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 — including hospitalization, intensive care, a ventilator or special equipment to help them breathe, and death — compared with non-pregnant people. Additionally, pregnant people with COVID-19 might be at increased risk of other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth (delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks). Learn more from the CDC about [COVID-19 and pregnancy](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnant-people.html).\n\nWe don’t know for sure if people with COVID-19 can spread the virus to babies through their breast milk, but the current evidence suggests that it is not likely.

You may not be protected from COVID-19 until you are fully vaccinated, which is 14 days after your final shot. This is why it is important to continue following the [prevention steps](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19) until you are fully vaccinated.\n\nIt may be hard to tell the difference between side effects from the vaccine and symptoms from sickness if you get infected with COVID-19 between vaccine doses. While everyone’s reaction may be different, [vaccine side effects](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4822) usually start within 12 to 24 hours after your vaccination. They should go away within a few days.\n\nIf symptoms get worse or last longer than a few days, contact your health care provider. They should be able to suggest next steps and maybe a COVID-19 test. Getting the vaccine [will not affect your COVID-19 test results](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4778).",

Both of them are over 94% effective with two doses.\n\n*   Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are given about 21 days apart.\n*   Doses of the Moderna vaccine are given about 28 days apart.\n\nFor the vaccine to be the most effective and help prevent you from getting COVID-19, it’s best to get your second shot as close to the recommended schedule as possible. It is okay to get your shot 4 days before the recommended schedule. But if you miss your second dose, get it as soon as you can. However, if you are not able to get it close to the recommended schedule, it is okay to get it up to 42 days after your first dose. There is limited data on how effective the vaccine is, if the second dose is given after 42 days. Learn more about [why it is important to get two doses of the vaccine](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4830).\n\nOnce you get your vaccine card, put it in a safe place so you don’t lose it. You can keep it in your wallet or store it with other important documents. You can also take a picture of it with your smartphone, if you have one. You may need to show your card when you travel, so be sure to carry it with you and be prepared to show it when asked.\n\nWe recommend bringing your vaccine card to your second dose appointment, but it is not required. We also recommend getting your second dose at the same place you got your first dose.

This means that it can take 2 to 14 days after being exposed to get symptoms or to test positive. If you are **not** fully vaccinated, you should get tested twice — as soon as 2 days after the exposure and again 7 days after the exposure if you:\n\n*   think you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or\n*   are a close contact.\n\nFor your initial test, if the result is **negative**, you will need to remain in quarantine and follow guidance provided by the Health Department. If the result is **positive**, you must follow isolation guidance provided by the Health Department.\n\nGetting tested right away means you may be able to find out if you have COVID-19 early. This initial test also helps the Health Department find other people who have COVID-19 more quickly.\n\nGetting tested before day 7 cannot be used to end quarantine early.

You will need to quarantine if you are a close contact or live with someone who tests positive for COVID-19 (unless you are [fully vaccinated](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4825) or [recently had COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4820)). If you are identified as a close contact, you will be contacted. This is known as contact tracing. The notification will come from the Health Department or a place you went to recently (for example, your employer, your child’s school, or your health care provider might contact you). They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time.\n\nLearn more about [what to expect from contact tracing](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4682).",

They might even affect your daily activities but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Common side effects are:\n\n*   Pain, swelling or redness on the arm where you got the shot\n*   Tiredness\n*   Headache\n*   Chills\n*   Muscle or joint pain\n*   Fever\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n\n**What to do about side effects:**\n\n*   After your vaccine, you can take pain relievers for any side effects you may have from the vaccine to help you feel better. Don't take them before you get the vaccine to prevent side effects.\n*   Call your health care or vaccine provider if side effects are worrying you or if they don’t go away after a few days.\n*   You can use V-safe to tell the CDC about any side effects and to get reminders for your second dose. V-safe is an optional smartphone tool that uses text messages and web surveys to provide personalized check-ins.  If you don’t have a smartphone, a family member can sign up for you. Learn more and [register for V-safe](http://www.cdc.gov/vsafe). V-safe is available in English, Spanish, Simplified Chinese or Korean.\n*   If you have a bad reaction after getting vaccinated, you or your health care provider can report it to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than [PCR tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4671) (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nAntigen tests are usually less sensitive than PCR tests, so they might miss some cases. Antigen tests could be more useful in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n*   **For surveillance purposes**, to see what COVID-19 activity might be occurring in a community.\n\nWhen used to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests are different from [antibody (serologic) tests](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4654), which identify people who have previously been infected with the COVID-19 virus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\nAntigen test results cannot be used to test out of quarantine early. Find out about [the option to end your quarantine early](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Use of Antigen Testing in Vermont – Health Update October 1, 2020](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-HAN-AntigenTesting.pdf)\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food and Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

            "answer": "**Why do I need two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine?**\n\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses, spaced about 3 to 4 weeks apart. We strongly recommend Vermonters get both doses for the highest level of protection from COVID-19.\n\n**Two doses of these vaccines are scientifically proven to be highly effective in preventing COVID-19.** Since the beginning, we have followed the science. Participants in the clinical trials who did not receive both doses were not followed for a long period of time, so we do not know for sure how well or how long one dose will protect you.\n\n**A two-dose vaccine is not new.** For some vaccines, like hepatitis B, shingles and HPV, two doses produce longer-lasting protection. While the first dose gets your immune system ready and offers some protection, the second dose boosts that protection by using your body’s new immune cells it created after the first dose. This “booster” increases the strength of your new antibody protection and makes it last longer.\n\n**Taking the full course of vaccine offers better protection against variants of the virus.** In fact, being only partially vaccinated, for example getting only one dose of a two-dose vaccine, could increase the risk of vaccine-resistant [variants of the virus that causes COVID-19](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4777). This is because the virus could be weakened with some antibody protection, but not stopped completely, creating the potential for the virus to mutate.\n\n**Some people experience stronger side effects after the second shot.** Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have equal doses in their first and second shots, but for some, stronger side effects are part of their body’s normal immune reaction to that “boost” in protection. Common side effects reported were pain at the injection site, fever, chills, tiredness and headache. These side effects typically go away within a few days.\n\nWhether you experience side effects or not, rest assured the vaccine is working to protect you, your family and your community.\n\nFind out [when you need to get your second shot](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4802).",

You can keep it in your wallet or store it with other important documents. You can also take a picture of it with your smartphone, if you have one. You may need to show your card when you travel, so be sure to carry it with you and be prepared to show it when asked.\n\nIf your vaccine requires a second dose, you should have scheduled your second dose at the clinic where you received your first dose. We recommend bringing your vaccine card to your second dose appointment, but it is not required.\n\nYou may want to protect your card. If you choose to get your vaccine card laminated, please note that the ink used to write in your dose could run when heat is applied. Also, if booster shots are needed, they won’t be able to be recorded if the card is laminated.\n\nIf you lost your vaccine card or your information is wrong, the Vermont Immunization Registry has your vaccination record.

            "answer": "**Is it possible to get COVID-19 even if I’m fully vaccinated?**\n\nYes. COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing serious disease, including hospitalization and death. But no vaccine is 100% effective. That means some people who are vaccinated may become infected with COVID-19. This is called a “vaccine breakthrough.” This happens with any vaccine including measles, mumps, flu and others. Fortunately, the percentage of people who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated should stay low. Among those who get COVID-19 after being vaccinated, few will get very sick.\n\n**Community Immunity**\n\nVaccine protection is more than one person being vaccinated. The more virus going around in the community, the higher your chances of coming into close contact with someone who is sick with COVID-19. When enough people in a community are protected against a contagious disease, it's very hard for it to spread. It is this community immunity that helps protect us all from getting sick.\n\n**Variants**\n\nCurrent data suggest that COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States offer protection against variants currently circulating in the United States. Vermont’s number of specimens connected to a COVID-19 infection after vaccination is too small to make any conclusions about the role variants play in causing infections among fully vaccinated people. \n\nThe Health Department sequences specimens and prioritizes any that are connected with an infection after vaccination.
