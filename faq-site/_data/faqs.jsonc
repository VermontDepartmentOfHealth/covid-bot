Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4 °F or greater) or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\nCall your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont’s free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\n[Learn more about COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19).",

The pressure to get a vaccine quickly must not outweigh the importance of its safety and efficacy.\n\nWe stand together with other health departments across the country, as well as the national Association of Immunization Managers, in our insistence that any vaccine made available to the public must first meet all U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety standards, and be recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), an independent national advisory committee.\n\nWhile we wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, the Health Department strongly recommends that everyone age 6 months and older get their flu shot.

Another person can become infected if the droplets land in their mouth or nose and possibly if the droplets are inhaled into the lungs. The virus might also spread to a person’s hands from a contaminated surface and then to their nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. Not everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.\n\nThere is [growing scientific evidence](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798) that smaller particles of the COVID-19 virus in the air indoors can infect people. These lighter, finer droplets — that we all exhale from coughing or talking — may stay in the air for several hours, especially when there’s poor ventilation or overcrowding.\n\nYou could become infected if you have indoor contact with those aerosols for an extended period of time.\n\nFollow these general precautions to help prevent the virus from spreading:\n\n*   Keep a 6-foot distance from people you don’t live with.\n*   Wear a [face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) when you can’t keep 6 feet apart.\n*   Avoid crowded indoor spaces.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n\nLearn more from the CDC about [how to protect yourself and others from getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).",

How can I help my children from getting sick?**\n\nNo. Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date. However, a few children have developed [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/MIS-C-Fact-Sheet.pdf). Currently, information about MIS-C is limited, and the CDC is working to learn more.\n\nYou can encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy.\n\n*   **Stay home if you are sick** and avoid people who are sick.\n*   **Wear a face mask or covering**.\n*   **Keep a 6-foot distance from others** who are not part of your household.\n*   **Avoid crowded indoor spaces.**\n*   **Wash hands often** using soap and water (or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol).\n*   **Socialize with household members or other trusted households** that are also taking health and safety precautions.\n*   **Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily** in household common areas (like tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remotes, handles, desks, toilets, sinks).\n*   **Wash items** including washable plush toys, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. If possible, wash items using the warmest appropriate water setting for the items and dry items completely. Dirty laundry from a person who is sick can be washed with other people’s items.\n\nVermonters can get together with friends and family.

Here is how you can protect yourself from COVID-19, and avoid spreading it to others:\n\n*   Stay at home to protect others if you are sick.\n*   Keep gatherings small and have them outside whenever possible.\n*   When you leave home, stay at least 6 feet away from people you don’t live with.\n*   Wear a [face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) in public settings when you cannot keep a 6-foot distance from other people, for example, at a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Masks may be required in some places like on public transportation.\n*   Avoid crowded indoor spaces.\n*   Avoid close contact with people who are sick.\n*   Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n*   Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Throw used tissues in the trash. Then immediately wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.\n*   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place, going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n*   If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if your hands look dirty.\n*   [Clean and disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html) frequently touched objects and surfaces (like tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches, remote controllers, handles, desks, toilets, sinks) using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe\n*   Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19.

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nFace masks or coverings are not required when you are doing strenuous exercise or activities. They are also not required for – and should not be worn by:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove the face mask without assistance\n*   Anyone who has a medical or behavioral reason for not wearing a face mask\n\nIf you have a medical or developmental condition or have trouble breathing, you are not required to show evidence or documentation of your condition.\n\nBusinesses and other entities may also post signage explaining their mask requirements and can deny entry or service to people who are not wearing a mask, including people who are not required to wear a mask. However, the business must provide another way for people who are unable to wear a mask to access the business (for example, offering curbside pick-up or delivery or other creative solution).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, everyone should keep a 6-foot distance from others, avoid crowded indoor spaces, wash their hands often, and stay home if they are sick.\n\nLearn more about:\n\n*   [wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [how to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to follow a few key [prevention tips](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#prevention). If you think you should be tested for COVID-19, talk with your health care provider. If you don't have a provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected to care, or contact the nearest [federally qualified health center](https://bistatepca.org/community-resources/vt-health-centers) or one of [Vermont's free & referral clinics](https://vtfreeclinics.org/).\n\nThe Health Department **recommends testing** for:\n\n*   People with [COVID-19 symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html).\n*   People who have had [close contact](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf) (within 6 feet for about 15 minutes) with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.\n*   People who are referred by their health care provider for testing for another reason.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested before visiting another household or attending a gathering just to make sure they're okay.** You could have already been exposed but may have been tested too early for it to show up on the test, or you could be exposed to COVID-19 after you are tested. Testing is not [prevention](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#prevention), and a negative test does not necessarily mean it is safe to gather with others.\n\n**We do not recommend people get tested frequently.** We do not recommend routine, repeated testing just for peace of mind.

Choose outdoor settings over indoor settings. Pay attention to the size of the space, crowding, the number of people there, and if they are wearing face coverings and keeping a 6-foot distance.\n*   Choose activities that don’t require close contact. Minimize close contact while talking or doing anything that requires exertion, shouting or singing.\n*   Keep your social circle small. Choose a few other trusted households that are also taking health and safety precautions.\n\nThe CDC recommends [other populations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations.html) also take extra precautions, like pregnant people, people experiencing homelessness, and people with disabilities.",

While contact tracers work to identify all close contacts, all might not be identified. If you think that you might be a close contact but didn't get a call from the Health Department, you may take precautions by quarantining for 14 days since the last day you were in contact with that person, and get tested on day 7 or after if you have not had any symptoms.\n\nIf you are not a close contact of a person who tested positive, you can continue to take the general precautions to slow the spread of the virus: keep a 6-foot distance from people you don't live with, [wear a face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) when you can't keep 6 feet apart, avoid crowded indoor spaces, wash your hands often, and stay home if you are sick.\n\n[Learn how contact tracing for COVID-19 works in Vermont.](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing)",

Do I need to quarantine when I return?**\n\nCOVID-19 cases and deaths have been reported in all 50 states, and the situation is constantly changing. Travel increases your chances of getting and spreading COVID-19. According to the CDC, staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from getting sick. Don’t travel if you are sick or travel with someone who is sick. Read the CDC’s [considerations for travelers](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html) if you are thinking of traveling away from your local community.\n\nVermonters may travel to [certain counties with low rates of active cases](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/restart/cross-state-travel). If you make your trip in a personal vehicle (including a rental vehicle or private plane), you do not need to quarantine upon return to Vermont. If you travel out of state to a location other than those counties with low rates of active cases, you must quarantine in Vermont for 14 days upon return. This includes day trips.\n\nYou have the [option to get a PCR test on day 7](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4692) and end your quarantine with a negative test result. \n\nCheck the Health Department’s webpage for [what to do when you return to Vermont](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/traveling-vermont).",

A [study by the National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces) found that the COVID-19 virus can live up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard, and up to three days on stainless steel and plastic surfaces.\n\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.\n\nRegularly cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces (for example, tables, countertops, doorknobs, light switches, toilets, faucet handles and sinks) are the best ways to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus in households and community settings.\n\nFollow the steps for [how to clean and disinfect your home](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html) from the CDC.",

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nWearing a homemade cloth face mask or covering can offer some protection to others. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms. The cloth face mask or covering can contain respiratory droplets and prevent them from spreading to others.\n\nLearn more about:\n\n*   [wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [how to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

However, some stores are choosing to no longer allow reusable bags and containers at this time. Check with your local store for their current policies.\n\nStores and food service establishments no longer provide plastic bags at check-out. You have the option to purchase paper bags for 10 cents each or use reusable bags. If a store has temporarily banned reusable bags, consider putting your groceries back into your cart and bag them at your car. Some stores and food establishments may still offer plastic bags after July 1 since they are allowed to use the ones they currently have in stock until they are gone.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the COVID-19 virus may live for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. It is important to remember to wash your hands before you eat and to avoid touching your face.\n\nMake sure you clean your reusable bags regularly, which can also help prevent illnesses from bacteria, such as _E.coli_, that are from meat and unwashed fruits and vegetables.\n\nFind more information and tips about the [single-use plastics ban](https://dec.vermont.gov/content/single-use-products-law) from the Department of Environmental Conservation.",

It is for people with no symptoms who are returning to Vermont from certain out-of-state locations or people who were in [close contact with someone sick with COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html). Quarantine helps prevent the spread of disease before a person knows they are sick or if they are infected with the virus and don’t have symptoms.\n\nQuarantine means staying at a home or dwelling for 14 days since the day they were potentially exposed to COVID-19 before doing any activities outside of the home, like grocery shopping or getting together with friends or family. People in quarantine should separate themselves from others and check themselves for symptoms.\n\nWe strongly encourage anyone in quarantine to sign up for [daily symptom check reminders](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/EpiInfoWebSurvey/Home/9c2e5941-1ba7-4ab4-84be-558ba7684f5d).\n\n**Self-observation** is for other Vermonters who don’t have symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLearn more about [isolation, quarantine and self-observation](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-chart-observation-isolation-quarantine_final.pdf).\n\nCheck the [latest quarantine guidance](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/traveling-vermont) for people visiting or returning to Vermont.",

Watch a quick [video by the CDC on how to make your own cloth face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html).\n\nYou are required to wear a face mask or covering in public spaces in Vermont any time it is not possible to keep a 6-foot distance from others who are not part of your household. This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces (for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nLearn more about:\n\n*   [wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [how to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

Can animals carry the virus on their skin or fur?**\n\nAccording to the CDC, at this time, there is no evidence that animals play a large role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, and no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can spread to people from the skin, fur or hair of pets.\n\nBased on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.\n\nPets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands before and after interacting with them.

We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.\n\nIf a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated.

The team begins [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time [while the person was infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.\n\nVermont is taking additional measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities.

We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.",

It’s also used to identify people who have been in close contact with them, so they can take steps to stop the disease from spreading to others. \n\n**If you test positive for COVID-19**, you will get a call from the Health Department. A trained public health worker, called a contact tracer, will give you guidance to stay home and away from other people until you recover. This stops the virus from spreading to other people. They will ask you questions about your symptoms, activities, and who you may have come into contact with during a specific period of time. This information is only used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n**If you are identified as a close contact,** a contact tracer will call you and tell you the date when you may have been exposed. They will give you guidance to stay home and away from others for a certain amount of time. They will ask you to watch for symptoms and ask if you need any help while staying home.\n\n[Learn how contact tracing for COVID-19 works in Vermont](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing).\n\n**It’s important to answer any call from the Health Department** and to answer questions as completely as possible to make sure everyone knows what steps to take to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nThe Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a “robo” (computer-generated voice) call for this service.\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.",

A trusted household is one that has taken seriously the importance of following the general precautions in their day-to-day lives.\n\nConsider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nTo keep COVID-19 from spreading, we must continue to:\n\n*   Wear a face mask or covering over your nose and mouth.\n*   Stay home and away from others if you are sick or have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19.\n*   Keep a 6-foot distance from others who are not part of your household.\n*   Avoid crowded indoor spaces.\n*   Wash your hands frequently (use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not available).\n*   Cough and sneeze into your elbow (even if you are wearing a face mask or covering).\n*   Limit travel to within Vermont, or to [places that have been identified as low risk](https://accd.vermont.gov/covid-19/restart/cross-state-travel), as much as possible and limit non-essential stops when you do travel.\n\nThe risk for severe illness increases with age and is higher for older adults and people of any age with certain underlying medical conditions.

The virus has been found in untreated wastewater, but there has been no evidence that a person can get COVID-19 from being exposed to untreated wastewater or sewerage systems.\n\nAccording to the CDC, it is thought that the COVID-19 virus does not spread through standard municipal and individual septic system wastewater treatment practices. Guidance will be updated if anything new is learned.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large storm events during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rain events, and do not swallow the water.\n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, be sure to follow these general precautions to prevent the spread of the virus: keep a 6-foot distance from people you don’t live with, [wear a face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) when you’re not in the water and when you can't keep 6 feet apart, avoid crowded indoor spaces, wash your hands often, and stay home if you are sick.

At this time, the supplies needed for this type of test are limited. This type of test is being prioritized for different groups of people who may not be able to tolerate the longer swab that collects samples from the back of the nose and throat, called a nasopharyngeal or NP swab. This includes children, patients at risk of increased bleeding or complications, patients with nasal irregularities (for example, polyps, deviated septum), people who need regular and repeated testing (for example, employees or residents of skilled nursing facilities), and those without the cognitive ability to understand the testing procedure.\n\nYour health care provider will determine if you should be referred for a nasal swab.

Face shields are generally not recommended because they are more for health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in. However, if your work environment or health does not allow you to wear a cloth face mask, wearing a face shield is better than having no barrier on your nose and mouth.\n\nOutdoor workers who are doing strenuous work that causes heavy breathing are not required to wear a face mask or covering when it is hot outside. Workers should keep masks with them and wear them when they are not exerting themselves (for example talking, resting, or interacting with other co-workers or people). It is important that workers keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when they are not wearing a mask.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

            "answer": "**What is an antigen test?**\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a newer type test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. According to the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, antigen tests are only recommended for people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms. More studies are required before antigen testing can be recommended for people without symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). When used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. \n\nWe are monitoring how these antigen tests evolve and how results can best be used. Right now, people who test positive from antigen tests are not considered to have a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 and are not included in our total number of cases. However, we consider these cases “presumptive positives” and recommend they follow the same guidelines as a positive case to stay home (self-isolate). We also conduct [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) and recommend a PCR test to confirm the positive result.\n\nAntigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the coronavirus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food & Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

This includes both indoor and outdoor public spaces ((for example, businesses, public buildings, parks) and group living settings (for example, long-term care facilities, nursing homes, apartment and condo complexes).\n\nIn private settings with people you don’t live with (for example, at a gathering with family and friends in your backyard or riding in a car), we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nWearing face masks or coverings helps keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing face masks or coverings, everyone should keep a 6-foot distance from others, avoid crowded indoor spaces, wash their hands often, and stay home if they are sick.\n\nA face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n*   Wash your hands before putting it on.\n*   Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n*   Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n*   Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n*   Keep it on until you get home.\n*   Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n*   Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nIf you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot outside, you should take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place. It is important that you keep a 6-foot distance from others whenever possible, especially when you are not wearing a mask.\n\nLearn more about:\n\n*   [wearing face masks to keep COVID-19 from spreading](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   [face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)\n*   [how to select, clean and wear your face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html)\n\nThe State of Vermont is offering a limited number of free cloth face masks to the public.

In private settings with people you don’t live with, we recommend that you wear a face mask or covering when it’s not possible to stay 6 feet apart. However, for some people, and in some cases, a face shield may be an option.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by respiratory droplets released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Face shields are typically used in health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in and not spreading the virus.\n\nIf you have trouble breathing or if you work in a setting where it is difficult to wear a face mask or covering, wearing a face shield is better than wearing nothing over your nose and mouth. People who have trouble breathing can also wear a light-weight bandanna or cloth covering tied to be open at the bottom. In [school settings](https://education.vermont.gov/documents/guidance-strong-healthy-start-health-guidance), students and adults are allowed to wear face shields, and in [child care settings](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-Health-Guidance-Childcare-Summer-Programs.pdf), providers, teachers and staff are allowed to wear face shields.\n\nFace shields should extend below the chin, to the ears on both sides, and there should be no exposed gap between the forehead and the shield’s headpiece.

On July 27, the Vermont Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics asked schools to prioritize in-person attendance for preschool to grade 5, and for students with special needs.\n\nWe know much more about the virus now than we did in March when schools closed for the spring.

We also have robust testing and [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19#contacttracing) system in Vermont that will support schools in containing the virus if there is a case.\n\nChildren need structure, relationships with their peers, teachers, and other adults for their academic, social, and emotional development. Although remote learning is an important tool during the pandemic, it can lead to even greater gaps in equity. Public health and education experts considered all these factors when writing Vermont’s guidance to reopen schools, which focuses on the safety of teachers, staff, and students.\n\nWe are seeing more cases of COVID-19 in children nationwide and in Vermont, but that is not surprising as states have reopened, and more testing has become available.\n\nWe recognize there may be cases in schools as they reopen. This is why Vermont’s reopening guidance outlines ways to keep the virus out of schools and prevent it from spreading through physical distancing, face masks or coverings, hand hygiene, and contact tracing.\n\nLearn more about [what parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf) as schools reopen for the fall.",

            "answer": "**How can I be safe from COVID-19 infection and prevent an overdose?**\n\n[Substance use may increase the risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/other-at-risk-populations/people-who-use-drugs/QA.html), but more evidence is needed. At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl in them, an opioid. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\n**If you are alone:**\n\n*   Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them you’re going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they don’t hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.\n*   Call [Never Use Alone](http://neverusealone.com/) at 800-648-3570 or message them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Neverusealone/). They’ll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you don’t respond after a certain period of time.\n*   Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**If you’re not alone:**\n\n*   Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people you’re with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household don’t need to stay 6 feet apart.\n*   Anyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.\n*   Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they aren’t using at the moment.\n*   Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:**\n\n*   Use one drug at a time (don’t mix).\n*   Know your tolerance. Use less if you haven’t used in a while, or if you’ve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\n*   Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\n*   Start low and go slow. You can use more later.\n*   Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\n*   Consider getting on medication assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\n*   Call 802-565-LINK or go to [VTHelplink](https://vthelplink.org/app/account/opa_result) to find a treatment center.\n\n**About wearing face masks or coverings:**\n\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you can’t take your own mask off (like if you’re nodding out), you shouldn’t wear one. When using substances with other people, particularly opioids, you may choose to stay 6 feet apart and not wear masks.\n\n**More information:**\n\n*   [Tips to prevent an opioid overdose](https://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/) (Harm Reduction Coalition)\n*   [Helping during an overdose and finding Naloxone](https://www.healthvermont.gov/emergency/injury/opioid-overdose-prevention) (Health Department)\n*   [Guidance for People Who Use Substances on COVID-19](https://yale.app.box.com/v/COVID19HarmReductionGuidance) (Yale)\n*   [Safer Drug Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak](https://harmreduction.org/miscellaneous/covid-19-guidance-for-people-who-use-drugs-and-harm-reduction-programs/?utm_source=all+IRETA+communications&utm_campaign=c611c175b0-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_03_16_01_32&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5cec8dc768-c611c175b0-137425257&mc_cid=c611c175b0&mc_eid=7bcfbcf675) (Harm Reduction Coalition)",

            "answer": "**What if there is a case of COVID-19 in school?**\n\nThe Health Department quickly responds every time we receive a positive test result for COVID-19. A contact tracer calls the person who tested positive (or their parent) within 24 hours, asks them questions about their recent activities and who they’ve been in contact with during their infectious period, and gives instructions on staying home. The team contacts the school if the person was there while infectious. Schools do not need to take action if someone with COVID-19 was not at the school during their infectious period.\n\nThe Health Department will:\n\n*   Work closely with the school and ask about who had close contact (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes) with the person with COVID-19 while they were infectious, like classmates and teachers. Information that identifies the individual will only be shared if consent was given.\n*   Reach out to all people with close contact and give them information about quarantine and testing.\n*   Discuss next steps with school administration, including whether to temporarily move to remote instruction.\n\nThe school will:\n\n*   Close off any areas where the person spent longer than 15 minutes (like a classroom, gym, or a cafeteria) then clean and disinfect the areas.\n*   Communicate with parents and staff about the situation, and encourage everyone to answer calls from the Health Department for contact tracing, if they get called. Contact tracers only call the people who our infectious disease experts determine have had close contact with a person with COVID-19 while they were infectious.\n*   Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the school.\n*   Make sure that anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 stays home from school (isolation) until they can return.\n*   Make sure that anyone who had close contact with someone with COVID-19 while they were infectious stays home from school (quarantine) until they can return. Someone under quarantine does not have COVID-19 and cannot pass it to others, but they may become infected within 14 days.\n\nLearn more about the [Health Department's response to COVID-19 cases](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-Flowchart-When-Someone-Tests-Positive.pdf).\n\nSeveral resources for school administrators, nurses and COVID coordinators are available on the [Health Department School web page](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/schools-colleges-child-care-programs) including a quick reference guide for when [someone with COVID-19 was at school while infectious](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-School-Case-Quick-Reference.pdf).\n\nYou can learn more about that and other information about [what parents can expect for pre-K through 12th grade](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-FAQ4Families-Schools.pdf) as schools reopen for the fall.",
