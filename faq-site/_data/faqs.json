For more information on staying safe and healthy around animals including pets, visit CDC’s [www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.html).\n\nIt is also important to include pets in your family’s preparedness planning efforts, including having a two-week supply of pet food and pet medicines available.

Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a facemask.

Testing is not treatment and not everyone needs to be tested. If you are sick, many people can manage their symptoms at home with rest, drinking fluids and taking fever-reducing medicine, when needed.\n\nAs of March 20, 2020, health care providers can submit samples to the University of Vermont Medical Center Laboratory (UVMMC) for prioritization. However, testing resources in Vermont and in the U.S. are currently limited. For the immediate term, the Health Department lab will prioritize testing samples from the following groups with symptoms of COVID-19: health care workers, patients who are hospitalized, long-term care facility residents, people who are incarcerated, people who are immunocompromised, and other high-priority groups with symptoms. All other samples submitted to the lab will be tested as quickly as resources allow. \n\nAs of March 27, the Health Department announced new guidance to expand testing to include more people with mild to moderate symptoms. The process is still the same – if you are having symptoms of COVID-19, you should call your health care provider to arrange for being tested. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19. \n\nAnyone who meets the medical requirements for testing for COVID-19 can be tested at no cost. \n\nThe number of Vermonters who were tested for COVID-19 is updated daily on our website [healthvermont.gov/COVID19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/infectious-disease/2019-novel-coronavirus).",

While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\n* As much as possible, stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom. Stay at least six feet away from others in your home at all times. Don’t share household items.\n\n* Have someone else care for your pets. Although no animals have been reported to get sick with COVID-19, people with the virus should limit contact with animals until more information is known. If you do care for your pet, wash your hands before and after.\n\nDaily cleaning and washing:\n\n* Clean and disinfect surfaces in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.\n\n* Thoroughly wash household items, like utensils, after using.\n\n* Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with COVID-19, there is additional guidance at healthvermont.gov/COVID19 Frequently Asked Questions section – “If you or a family member are sick.” \n\nFor more information, visit the CDC \"Steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if you are sick.\"\n\nIf you are a close contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19, you should:\n\n1.

They will be assessed for their exposure risk and given health guidance. Where appropriate, they will receive recommendations for self-isolation or other restrictions. For the purpose of identifying close contacts, the infectious period starts two days (48 hours) before any symptoms began and continues until the person has recovered.\n\nClose contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. In these situations, you should observe yourself for symptoms.

This specifically refers to the closing of bars and restaurants for dine-in service and the Department of Motor Vehicles for in-person services, which would have otherwise expired on April 6. This timeframe will be reevaluated as that date approaches. For details, please review the addendum at [https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-8-executive-order-01-20](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-8-executive-order-01-20).\n\n* On April 2, Governor Scott announced new steps in the State’s plan to prepare for a surge in COVID-19 cases. The State has coordinated with communities and hospitals statewide, including Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, and the Vermont National Guard to increase capacity in the event of a surge of COVID-19 patients who require medical care. These sites will be operated in close coordination with health care providers and will only be used if hospitals exceed their capacity. For details, please see the press release https://governor.vermont.gov/press-release/governor-phil-scott-announces-additional-medical-surge-locations  \n\n \n\n* On Monday, March 30, as an addendum to his emergency declaration, Gov. Scott directed residents and non-residents coming from outside the state for anything other than an essential purpose to home-quarantine for 14 days and strongly discouraged travel to Vermont by those located in COVID-19 “hot spots.” Gov. Scott is encouraging compliance with newly released CDC guidance around interstate travel from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, which advised residents of those states to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days. For details, please review the addendum at [https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%207%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%207%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf)  \n\n* On March 30, as an addendum to his emergency declaration, Gov. Scott ordered all lodging operations to be suspended. Lodging facilities – which includes hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, inns, short term rentals (e.g. VRBO, Homeaway, Airbnb, etc.), and all public and private camping facilities and RV parks – are to be closed except for stated exemptions when supporting the state’s COVID-19 response. Online lodging reservations are also suspended. The Vermont State Police and local law enforcement will monitor lodging providers for compliance and work with the Attorney General’s Office on additional compliance measures if needed. For details, please review the addendum at [https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%207%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%207%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf)\n\n* On March 26, the governor directed schools for preK-12 students to remain dismissed for in-person instruction for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year, unless otherwise ordered by the Governor if the COVID-19 response should allow. Schools are required to have continuity of learning plans for remote learning implemented on or before Monday, April 13, 2020.\n\n* Effective March 25 at 5:00 p.m., the governor ordered all businesses and not-for-profit entities not expressly exempted in the order to suspend all in-person business operations. Operations that can be conducted online or by phone, or sales that can be facilitated with curbside pickup or delivery only, can continue. The Order provides exemptions for businesses and entities providing services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. This includes – but is not limited to – health care operations; retail serving essential human needs, like grocery stores, pharmacies and hardware stores; fuel products and supply; news media; maintenance of critical infrastructure; and transportation and critical manufacturing sectors. For a full list, please review the order at https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-6-executive-order-01-20. \n\n* March 24, Governor Scott directed Vermonters to stay at home, leaving only for essential reasons, critical to health and safety, such as: personal safety, groceries or medicine, curbside pick-up of goods, meals or beverages, medical care, exercise, or care of others. If leaving the home, Vermonters should adhere to social distancing policies, including remaining six feet from others (except for those with whom they share a home) and thoroughly and regularly washing hands.\n\n* Effective on Monday, March 23 at 8:00 p.m., Governor Scott directed all businesses and not-for-profit entities in the state to put telecommuting or work-from-home procedures into place, to the maximum extent possible.\n\n* March 21, Governor Scott amended his emergency declaration to further reduce the allowable size of non-essential mass gatherings. Gatherings are now limited to no more than 10 people at the same time in a single space. A \"non-essential mass gathering\" does NOT include normal operations at airports, bus or railway stations people may be in transit.\n\n* March 21, the governor ordered gyms, fitness centers and similar exercise facilities, hair salons and barbers, nail salons, spas and tattoo parlors to close all in-person operations no later than 8:00 p.m. on Monday, March 23.\n\n* The governor also ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants statewide effective Tuesday, March 17 at 2 p.m. until April 6. This may be extended. Establishments can continue to offer food takeout and delivery.\n\n* On March 16, the governor amended his executive order prohibiting all large non-essential mass gatherings to 50 people, or 50% of a building’s occupancy level, whichever is lower.\n\n* On March 15, the governor directed the orderly dismissal of all schools, and cancellation of all school related activities, no later than Wednesday, March 18. This directive, which will be distributed to schools later today, will last through April 6 -- but may very well be extended for a longer period.\n\n* On March 13, the Governor issued an executive order to declare a state of emergency and define prohibitions related to large gatherings and visiting vulnerable settings to support the response and contain community spread.\n\n* On March 11 the state activated its Emergency Operations Center to support the Health Department’s response.\n\n* On February 29, the Governor directed Vermont Emergency Management to form a task force representing all sectors of the state to develop a comprehensive response plan. \n\n* Effective March 25 at 5:00 p.m., the governor orders all businesses and not-for-profit entities not expressly exempted in the order to suspend all in-person business operations. Operations that can be conducted online or by phone, or sales that can be facilitated with curbside pickup or delivery only, can continue. The Order provides exemptions for businesses and entities providing services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security.

Foodborne exposure to this virus is not known to be a way to get COVID-19. \n\nIt is important to always follow general food safety guidelines:\n\n* Wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds before preparing or eating food \n\n* Throughout the day, wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.\n\nIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\n\nTo help prevent spread of the virus, the CDC recommends people practice frequent “hand hygiene,” which is either washing hands with soap or water or using an alcohol-based hand rub. The CDC also recommends routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces.\n\nYou should always handle and prepare food safely, including keeping raw meat separate from other foods, refrigerating fresh foods (perishable), and cooking meat to the right temperature to kill harmful germs. \n\nFor more information on food safety, visit https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/.",

This includes the recommendation of the federal government that those who have passed through or left New York City should self-monitor and stay home for a period of 14 days. \n\nWhile in quarantine, residents and non-residents may need to rely on neighbors, friends or family living outside of the household to deliver groceries to their home. Check your local grocery store to see if there is an option for home delivery or look for online sources for home delivery. Groceries should always be left at your door. Wash your hands before and after if a signature for receipt is required. \n\nPermitted “essential purpose” travel includes travel required for personal safety; food, beverage or medicine; medical care; care of others; and to perform work, services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security.\n\nVisitors are instructed not to travel to Vermont if they are displaying symptoms or if they are travelling from cities and regions identified as COVID-19 “hot spots,” including, among others, the states of Florida and Louisiana and the cities of Detroit, Chicago and New York City. \n\nIn addition, residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut should stay in their home states in strict compliance with CDC travel guidance issued Saturday, March 28, 2020. This is essential if you will be in close contact with people who are older adults or have a severe chronic health condition. \n\nFor more information, visit https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-7-executive-order-01-20",

The American Red Cross of Northern New England faces a severe blood shortage and many local food banks and other community organizations are in need of support and donations of supplies. \n\n**Give blood**: Visit the American Red Cross to learn how to safely donate blood: [www.redcross.org/local/new-hampshire-vermont.html](https://www.redcross.org/local/new-hampshire-vermont.html). \n\nSupport your local Food Bank. Donate online at [vtfoodbank.org](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/) or you can text GIVEHEALTH to 85511. If you're in need of help, please visit [www.vtfoodbank.org/gethelp](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/gethelp)\n\nYou can also help your neighbors – older adults and at-risk people should stay home as much as possible. Go shopping for a neighbor or someone else in need, keep an older neighbor company by phone or at a safe distance. When volunteering please follow the guidelines on being a good neighbor at: [https://vem.vermont.gov/neighborly](https://vem.vermont.gov/neighborly).",

Exercise and taking in Vermont’s natural beauty is important for our mind and bodies. We can safely continue to enjoy the outdoors with these measures:\n\n* **Stay close to home.** Find areas close you can walk or bike to. If you must drive, please limit the distance from home to ten miles, and only drive with members of your household.\n\n* **Practice social distancing while outside.** You lower your risk when you stay at least 6 ft apart from others. This includes having your dog on a leash and close to you.\n\n* **Be cautious and choosing low-risk activities to avoid injury.** This will help lower the burden on the our hospitals and health care system. \n\n* **Respect signs for closed areas, trails and land.** Check https://www.trailfinder.info/ to see if your trail is currently open before you visit. \n\nFor more information, visit the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation at https://fpr.vermont.gov/recreation/outdoor-recreation-and-covid-19",
