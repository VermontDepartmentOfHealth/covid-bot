Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two:\n\n*   COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people.\n*   It can take longer before people show symptoms of COVID-19, and people can be contagious with the COVID-19 virus for longer.\n\nDoctors and scientists are working to estimate the death rate of COVID-19, but currently, it is thought to be substantially higher (possibly 10 times or more) than that of most strains of the flu.\n\nFind more information about [differences and similarities between flu and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm) from the CDC.\n\nThere are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading the flu and COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).",

Face shields are generally not recommended because they are more for health care settings to protect the person wearing it from droplets getting into their eyes. Face masks or coverings, like a cloth face mask or bandanna, do a better job than face shields of keeping droplets in. \n\nMedical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders.

                "answerBody": "Vermont is starting a phased approach to reopen the economy, balancing overall social and economic wellbeing with preventing a rise in COVID-19 that would set us back. On April 17, the Governor issued guidance on [Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase 1](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-10-executive-order-01-20). On April 24, the Governor issued additional guidance on [Work Smart/Stay Safe: Phase 2](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-11-executive-order-01-20) to expand businesses allowed to operate. See up-to-date [sector-specific guidance from the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD)](http://accd.vermont.gov/content/stay-home-stay-safe-sector-specific-guidance). Guidance includes requiring employees to wear non-medical cloth face coverings (bandanna, scarf, or non-medical mask, etc.) over their nose and mouth when in the presence of others.\n\nBusinesses, nonprofit and government organizations that do not meet the criteria outlined in this first phase must suspend in-person operations and ensure all workers work remotely whenever possible.\n\nOperations that can be conducted online or by phone, or sales that can be facilitated with curbside pickup or delivery only, can continue, including restaurants that were providing takeout service under the previous closure order. Otherwise, non-exempt businesses must close.\n\nEssential services and functions remain in operation. Businesses and entities providing services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security can remain in operation and are not subject to suspend in-person operation restrictions, but are expected to adhere to social distancing, hygiene and cleaning requirements. Essential state and local government services and functions remain open.

Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, [being indoors increases your risk](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4746) of spreading or getting COVID-19. Sleepovers involve close contact and indoor spaces with people who are outside your household, so they are prohibited.\n\nThere will always be some risk of COVID-19 when we leave home, but it is possible to live your life and stay safer. Look for three things to help weigh the risk when making plans or going out:\n\n*   **6-Foot Spaces**: Can I easily keep 6 feet from others?\n*   **Masks on Faces**: Will people wear masks?\n*   **Uncrowded Places**: Is there enough space for people to spread out?\n\nImagine these things as layers protecting us from getting and spreading COVID-19. The more layers we have, the lower the risk. Find more [tips on preventing COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/staysafevt).\n\nChildren can also continue to take advantage of technology to play games or keep in touch with friends and family. These changes will continue to be difficult, but we are all doing our part to slow down this pandemic.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Resources for families with children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/your-community/families-children)\n*   [Coping with family stress during COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/coping-stress)\n*   [Face coverings for children](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID19-childfacecovering.pdf)",

It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or an object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads. \n\nStores and food service establishments no longer provide plastic bags at check-out.

This includes the recommendation of the federal government that those who have passed through or left New York City should self-monitor and stay home for a period of 14 days. \n\nThis does not include people who have crossed into Vermont for “essential purposes.” This includes travel required for personal safety; food, beverage or medicine; medical care; care of others; and to perform work, services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. For more details, see the [Governor’s Addendum 6](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%206%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) to the Stay Home, Stay Safe Order.\n\nFor those who have crossed into Vermont for non-essential purposes and are being asked to stay home: While in quarantine, residents and non-residents may need to rely on neighbors, friends or family living outside of the household to deliver groceries to their home. Check your local grocery store to see if there is an option for home delivery or look for online sources for home delivery. Groceries should always be left at your door. Wash your hands before and after if a signature for receipt is required. Learn more about quarantine on the [What is isolation, quarantine and self-observation?](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-chart-observation-isolation-quarantine_final.pdf) chart.\n\nVisitors are instructed not to travel to Vermont if they are displaying symptoms or if they are traveling from cities and regions identified as COVID-19 “hot spots,” including, among others, the states of Florida and Louisiana and the cities of Detroit, Chicago and New York City. \n\nIn addition, residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut should stay in their home states in strict compliance with CDC travel guidance issued Saturday, March 28, 2020. This is essential if you will be in close contact with  older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions. \n\nFor more information, see the [Governor’s Addendum 7](https://governor.vermont.gov/content/addendum-7-executive-order-01-20) to the Stay Home, Stay Safe Order.",

                "answerBody": "As of March 30, Governor Scott ordered all lodging facilities to close, except for exemptions when supporting the state’s COVID-19 response. Lodging facilities include hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, inns, short term rentals (for example, VRBO, Homeaway, Airbnb, etc.), and all public and private camping facilities and RV parks.\n\nGovernor Scott announced on April 10 that lodging operators may accept new reservations for stays and events occurring on June 15 or later. However, if the Be Smart, Stay Safe Order is extended, they will need to rebook.\n\nAll reservations between May 15 and May 22 need to be canceled.

                "answerBody": "The Health Department has contacted all long-term care facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and senior housing facilities proactively to review strategies to prevent COVID-19 infection and develop plans to respond immediately if an infection is identified. We complete an in-depth assessment by phone and provide guidance about personal protective equipment and other infection prevention and control recommendations. We continue to stay in touch for any technical assistance needs and additional questions.\n\nIf a case of COVID-19 is associated with a long-term care facility, an epidemiology team is quickly activated. They contact the facility to provide recommendations and infection control support. The team begins [contact tracing](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/symptoms-sickness/close-contacts-contact-tracing) to determine the source of the infection and how it may be spreading. They ask questions and collect information to help identify anyone the patient had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than 6 feet apart for a long time [while the person was infectious](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4734).) The team communicates with close contacts to ensure isolation and quarantine guidelines are being followed, which will differ depending on the type of setting.\n\nVermont is taking additional measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 in certain types of group living facilities. This includes nursing homes, corrections facilities, residential homes for those with disabilities, residential treatment centers, assisted living facilities, state psychiatric care facilities, and homeless shelters. If a staff member or resident tests positive for COVID-19, universal testing of all staff and residents is offered at these facilities. Staff and residents may decline testing, and facilities may decline universal testing. Additionally, when a person tests positive at a skilled nursing facility, sequential testing (additional testing on following days) is offered to those who tested negative during the universal testing.\n\nResidents and staff of group living facilities and new admissions to nursing homes, assisted living residences, and residential care homes must complete the full 14-day quarantine period first.",

We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nWe will continue to use public health best practice – considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level – to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work.

                "answerBody": "Currently, health care providers can arrange testing for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, including those with mild symptoms. All residents and staff in group living settings, where there has been a single positive test, can also be tested. This includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities, prisons, and certain high-density residential buildings.\n\nWe are now working to ramp up our testing capabilities to conduct 1,000 tests a day – or 7,000 tests a week. That is about three times the average number of tests conducted over the last several weeks. We know that with increased testing we are likely to see a rise in positive cases, and we are prepared to handle such a scenario. A new Testing and Tracing Task Force has been created to guide and oversee this process.\n\nAs of April 29, we will now be able to expand testing for:\n\n* **Long-term care facilities and other group living settings**: If there is a person who has tested positive with COVID-19, they can be retested 3, 7, 10 and 14 days later. This is to help prevent community-wide outbreaks. For all sites, regardless of whether a person has tested positive, we will provide testing at intake, discharge, and for certain residents who require regular care outside of the facility.\n\n* **Health care personnel**: Testing will now be available for those who may have been exposed to patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, but who do not have symptoms themselves. Testing will also be offered to health care personnel who may be needed to aid their Restart Vermont efforts.\n\n* **Correctional facilities**: Now all corrections staff and inmates can be tested in the correctional facility, regardless if there has been a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nDuring the next phase, we will focus on expanded testing for health care and home health workers who have had direct contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. We will also consider testing those who are in 14-day quarantine due to possible exposure to COVID-19. We will increase opportunities for child care workers to be tested, too. Expanded testing will not happen all at once but will be phased in over the next few weeks.",

                "answerBody": "There is no evidence that the COVID-19 virus spreads to people through the water in lakes, oceans, rivers or other natural bodies of water.\n\nThe virus has been found in untreated wastewater, which means it could possibly enter lakes or rivers when untreated wastewater is discharged into waterways after rainstorms or for other reasons. According to the CDC, it is currently thought that the risk of getting COVID-19 from properly designed and maintained sewerage systems is low. There has been no evidence that a person can get COVID-19 by swallowing or coming in contact with water contaminated by feces (poop) from an infected person.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large rainstorms during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rainstorms, and do not swallow the water. \n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, plan to “arrive, play, and leave” — avoiding gathering before and after activities and giving others space. Follow these steps to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask any time you’re not in the water and can’t keep 6 feet apart from people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [healthy swimming](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/index.html) from the CDC.",

This is so we can see if the case numbers start to grow again as the state reopens. In Vermont, to achieve that rate, we need to test about 1,000 people per day.\n\nAs we test more and more people without symptoms, we are finding fewer and fewer cases. Early on, we only tested people who were very, very ill. Even then, a vast majority did not have COVID-19. Over time we started to test people who were moderately ill, then with mild symptoms, and now we also can include people who do not have symptoms.\n\nTesting helps us better understand the current rate of active infections of COVID-19 in Vermont, and helps to contain and slow the spread to others.

By carefully limiting these closer social interactions at this time it will be easier to identify who else may have been exposed and need to self-isolate in case someone becomes sick.\n\nTo keep COVID-19 from spreading, we must continue to:\n\n* Stay home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just don’t feel well.\n* Keep a 6-foot distance from others when you meet people outside of your household.\n* Wash your hands frequently (hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol is acceptable when soap and water are not available).\n* Cough and sneeze into your elbow (even if you are wearing a cloth face mask or covering).\n* Wear a cloth face mask or covering over your nose and mouth.\n* Limiting travel to within Vermont to the extent possible and when you do travel, limit non-essential stops.\n\nOlder adults (age 65 and over), and people with underlying medical conditions, like heart and lung disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe illness. They should continue to stay home, and family and friends should do everything they can to help keep them safe.",

                "answerBody": "An antigen test for COVID-19 is a newer type of test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. Antigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). Antigen tests are sometimes referred to as rapid (fast) tests.\n\nThough antigen tests may be available in Vermont, the Health Department only recommends antigen testing in certain circumstances:\n\n*   **For people who have symptoms of COVID-19**. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms.\n*   Health care providers may use antigen testing **when PCR testing is not available or when results are needed quickly**. This may be when people who are having symptoms get tested at their doctor’s office or when patients are being admitted to hospitals that don’t have a lot of PCR tests available.\n*   Antigen tests may be used **to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test**. Antigen tests are particularly helpful when used to test people in the early stages of infection (within the first 5 to 7 days of having COVID-19 symptoms) when the viral load is generally the highest. For example, long-term care facilities could screen residents and staff who are not having symptoms, but only if the tests were done at least weekly.\n\nWhen used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nWe are monitoring how these antigen tests evolve and how results can best be used. Right now, people who test positive from antigen tests are not considered to have a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 and are not included in our total number of cases. However, we consider these cases “presumptive positives” and recommend they follow the same guidelines as a positive case to stay home (self-isolate).

At the same time, an opioid overdose is an immediate risk to your life. Know that stimulants may also have fentanyl in them, an opioid. Below are some tips to help avoid an overdose or be better prepared if one happens and to reduce your risk of getting COVID-19.\n\n**If you are alone:**\n\n*   Call, text or send a Facebook or other type of message to someone you trust. Tell them you’re going to use and make a safety plan. For example, ask them to call you in a certain number of minutes. If they don’t hear from you, they should follow your plan. This could include coming over to check on you, calling a family member to check on you, or calling 911.\n*   Call [Never Use Alone](http://neverusealone.com/) at 800-484-3731 or message them on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Neverusealone/). They’ll wait while you use and call for emergency services if you don’t respond after a certain period of time.\n*   Have Naloxone with you. Put it where someone checking on you will easily see it.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**If you’re not alone:**\n\n*   Try to keep a 6-foot distance from the other people you’re with, unless you live with them. People who live in the same household don’t need to stay 6 feet apart.\n*   Anyone in the room should wear a face mask or covering if they are not using and not part of your household.\n*   Make sure someone you trust has naloxone on hand, and they aren’t using at the moment.\n*   Let them know when you are using so they can check in and give naloxone if needed.\n*   Wash your hands or use hand sanitizer.\n\n**Whenever and wherever you use, these tips can help prevent an overdose:**\n\n*   Use one drug at a time (don’t mix).\n*   Know your tolerance. Use less if you haven’t used in a while, or if you’ve been sick, lost weight, or if something else has lowered your tolerance.\n*   Test for fentanyl or assume there is fentanyl in your supply.\n*   Start low and go slow. You can use more later.\n*   Use in a lower risk way, like snorting instead of injecting or smoking.\n*   Consider getting on medication assisted treatment (methadone, bupe, suboxone, etc.).\n*   Call 802-565-LINK or go to [VTHelplink](https://vthelplink.org/app/account/opa_result) to find a treatment center.\n\n**About wearing face masks or coverings:**\n\nWearing a mask reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. However, substance use can impact your breathing and wearing a mask can make it worse. Plus, if you can’t take your own mask off (like if you’re nodding out), you shouldn’t wear one.

                "answerBody": "The CDC is working to learn more about the whole range of short- and long-term health effects associated with COVID-19. Many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and there are many ways the infection can affect someone’s health.\n\nOne of the health effects that the CDC is closely watching and working to understand relates to COVID-19 and the heart. Heart conditions associated with COVID-19 include inflammation and damage to the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, or inflammation of the covering of the heart, known as pericarditis. These conditions can occur by themselves or in combination. Heart damage may be an important part of severe disease and death from COVID-19, especially in older people with underlying illnesses. Heart damage like this might also explain some frequently reported long-term symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, and heart palpitations.\n\nThe risk of heart damage may not be limited to older and middle-aged adults. For example, young adults with COVID-19, including athletes, can also suffer from myocarditis. Severe heart damage has occurred in young, healthy people, but is rare. There may be more cases of mild effects of COVID-19 on the heart that can be diagnosed with special imaging tests, including in younger people with mild or minimal symptoms; however, the long-term significance of these mild effects on the heart are unknown. The CDC will continue to assess and provide updates as new data emerge.",

                "answerBody": "Because of the nature of how the virus spreads and how it survives, being indoors increases your risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus and becoming infected with it.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to [spread mainly through close contact](https://apps.health.vermont.gov/COVID/faq/#4537) from person to person, by respiratory droplets when people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe.\n\nIt is possible for COVID-19 to be transmitted under certain circumstances when very small respiratory droplets remain airborne.

If you can, run a humidifier to maintain a relative humidity of at least 40% in the room or area where people are gathering.\n*   **What the people are doing in the room or area** – Places where people can continuously wear a mask (for example, a family gathering without food or drink or a library) are less of a risk than places where people might take their masks off (for example, dinner at a friend’s house or a restaurant).\n\nThese are things you can do to keep from getting or spreading COVID-19 any time you are in an indoor environment, whether you are at home or in another building:\n\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n*   Wash your hands often.\n*   Keep your social circle small.\n*   Stay at least 6 feet away from people you don't live with.\n*   Wear a mask when you’re outside and can’t keep 6 feet apart or anytime you’re inside with people you don’t live with.\n\nLearn more about [why, how and when to do these things](https://www.healthvermont.gov/covid-19/protect-yourself-others/prevent-covid-19).\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [How to increase ventilation in your home](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [FAQs about indoor air and COVID-19](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/frequent-questions-about-indoor-air-and-coronavirus-covid-19) from the EPA\n*   [Hosting gatherings or cook-outs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#gatherings) from the CDC\n*   [Attending an event or gathering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/personal-social-activities.html#event) from the CDC\n*   [Holiday celebrations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html) from the CDC",

                "answerBody": "Generally, we recommend face masks and coverings that are made of at least two layers. Materials with tighter weaves, like cotton T-shirt material, are better at trapping respiratory droplets and preventing the spread of the COVID-19 virus than materials with loose weaves, like gaiters.\n\nIf you choose to wear a gaiter as a face covering, fold it over so it is two layers. Based on a few experiments in adults, gaiters with one layer trap the least amount of respiratory droplets. Gaiters with two layers trap more droplets than gaiters with one layer. Gaiters folded over into two layers have a similar effectiveness at trapping respiratory droplets as two layers of cotton T-shirt material.",

                "answerBody": "As life picks up again, we are learning there is a lot to discuss before seeing friends and family to feel comfortable and stay safe. Here are four tips to help have the “COVID Talk” – a conversation to negotiate boundaries and establish expectations ahead of time.\n\n1.  **Ask questions**. Before you get together, start with an open and honest conversation about what everyone has been doing to stay healthy and how they have been socializing. Consider everyone’s worries, boundaries and possible COVID-19 exposure risk so you can all get on the same page.\n2.  **Focus on what you need**. Using “I” instead of “you” statements helps people avoid feeling defensive or judged. In fact, blaming and shaming may actually increase push back and the likelihood of risk-taking behaviors. We recommend sharing what you’re comfortable with based on your own perspective instead of making demands of others.\n3.  **Share why it is important to you**. Share what level of risk works for you and why. It might be different for others. Some people feel comfortable taking on a moderate amount of risk in their lives. Others may not feel comfortable taking on any risk. Focusing on your own reasons for staying safe can help people to better understand and get on board.\n4.  **Set boundaries and stick to them**. We are all for keeping it friendly, open and non-judgmental – but that doesn’t mean you have to skimp on your safety! It’s OK to be clear and straightforward with what you need to feel safe and comfortable. It’s also okay to decline invitations or leave situations that feel too risky.

Recent data have shown that social gatherings, both inside and outside, at homes, bars and social clubs, and among sports teams is currently driving outbreaks in Vermont.\n\nBecause of this, Governor Scott has temporarily [prohibited social gatherings](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%208%20TO%20AMENDED%20AND%20RESTATED%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) with people from other households. People who live alone may get together with members of their immediate family living in a different household.\n\nWe must all do our part to slow the spread, ensure hospitals are not overwhelmed, help schools continue to offer in-person instruction, and keep as many Vermonters working as possible.\n\nVermont data at this time does not point to dining at restaurants, gyms, or other close contact business as drivers of outbreaks, and current safety protocols at these businesses are working.\n\nWe know this is difficult, but hope that as Vermonters follow this guidance, and we can return to the low case numbers we had and ease restrictions once again.",
