          "question": "What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
          "answer": "\n\nPeople with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Not everyone infected with the COVID-19 virus has symptoms. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:\n\n*   Fever (100.4 °F or greater) or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   New loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\nThis list does not include all possible symptoms. The CDC will continue to update the list of symptoms as more is learned. You can check your symptoms with the [CDC's self-checker tool](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html#).\n\nCall your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local [community or hospital-connected clinic](https://www.navigateresources.net/211vermont/Subcategory.aspx?;;0;;N;0;276976;Health%20Care,%20Dental%20Care). \n\n[Learn more about COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/response/coronavirus-covid-19/about-coronavirus-disease-covid-19).",

          "answer": "\n\nCOVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it makes people sick.\n\n**Cause**\n\nCOVID-19: Caused by one virus, the novel 2019 coronavirus, now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFlu: Caused by any of several different types and strains of influenza viruses.\n\n**Transmission**\n\nWhile both the flu and COVID-19 may be transmitted in similar ways, there is also a possible difference: COVID-19 might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.\n\n**Antiviral Medications**\n\nCOVID-19: Antiviral medications and other therapies are currently being tested to see if they can address symptoms.\n\nFlu: Antiviral medications can address symptoms and sometimes shorten the duration of the illness.\n\n**Vaccine**\n\nCOVID-19: No vaccine is available at this time, though development and testing are in progress.\n\nFlu: A vaccine is available and effective to prevent some of the most dangerous types or to reduce the severity of the flu.\n\nFind out more about [deaths and infections from Johns Hopkins Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu).",

          "question": "How does COVID-19 spread?",
          "answer": "\n\nThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, by respiratory droplets released when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. Another person can become infected if the droplets land in their mouth or nose and possibly if the droplets are inhaled into the lungs. The virus might also spread to a person’s hands from a contaminated surface and then to their nose, mouth, or possibly their eyes. Not everyone infected with the virus has symptoms.\n\nThere is [growing scientific evidence](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798) that smaller particles of the COVID-19 virus in the air indoors can infect people. These lighter, finer droplets — that we all exhale from coughing or talking — may stay in the air for several hours, especially when there’s poor ventilation or overcrowding. \n\nYou could become infected if you have indoor contact with those aerosols for an extended period of time.\n\nFollow these general precautions to help prevent the virus from spreading:\n\n*   Wear a [cloth face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf)\n*   Keep a 6-foot distance from others\n*   Wash your hands often\n*   Stay home if you are sick.\n\nLearn more from the CDC about [how to protect yourself and others from getting sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).",

          "answer": "\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, it is more important to make wearing cloth face masks or coverings a habit and to bring one with you whenever you leave home. Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when you cannot keep a 6-foot distance from others, for example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.\n\nPeople are required to wear cloth face masks or coverings over their nose and mouth when using public transportation—including buses, trains and ride services, and in mass transportation stations or terminals, including airports. Additionally, businesses and non-profit and government organizations may require customers or clients to wear cloth face masks or coverings.\n\nWearing cloth face masks or coverings may help keep people from spreading the virus. This is because the virus can spread even if a person does not have any symptoms.\n\nIn addition to wearing cloth face masks or coverings, everyone should keep a 6-foot distance from others, wash their hands often, and stay home if they are sick.\n\nA cloth face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n*   Wash your hands before putting it on.\n*   Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n*   Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n*   Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n*   Keep it on until you get home.\n*   Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n*   Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nSome people should never wear a cloth face mask or covering, including:\n\n*   Children under the age of 2\n*   Anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious\n*   Anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance\n\nMedical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth face masks or coverings for your yourself and loved ones.\n\nIf you feel like you are overheating and are having trouble breathing because it is hot outside, you should take off your mask, drink water, rest and seek shade or a cool place.

This includes when you’re inside a store, gathering with friends or family, or outside for exercise or a walk.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air from respiratory droplets released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. A person can be infected and not have any symptoms. In addition to keeping a 6-foot distance from others, everyone should:\n\n*   Stay home to protect others if you are sick.\n*   Wear a [cloth face mask or covering](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf) in public settings when you cannot keep a 6-foot distance from other people, for example, at the grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.\n*   Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public place, going to the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n*   Keep groups small when you can to limit any possible exposure, and follow health and safety precautions.

Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.\n*   **Get support from others.** Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially older adults and those who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.\n*   **Take care of the emotional health of your household members.** Pandemics can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the pandemic, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.\n*   **Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with.** As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal.

This is hopeful news.

Based on the limited information available at this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.\n\nPets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

          "answer": "\n\nSerologic testing measures antibodies in the blood of a person who has been infected with COVID-19, whether they felt sick or not. In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. \n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available would not produce results that are accurate or reliable enough in Vermont. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.\n\nThough certain providers may offer antibody testing in Vermont, the working group cautions against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals, for example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.",

Guidance will be updated if anything new is learned.\n\nThe Health Department recommends that towns do routine weekly _E. coli_ testing and after large storm events during the swim season. These tests are a good indication of the water quality, meaning that if the _E. coli_ levels are low, then COVID-19 virus levels are also expected to be low.\n\nThe best practices for staying healthy while swimming are to obey signage at beaches, do not swim during and following large rain events, and do not swallow the water.\n\nWhen you are at a beach or swimming spot, be sure to follow the general precautions to prevent the spread of the virus — wear a cloth face mask or covering when you’re not in the water, keep a 6-foot distance from others, wash your hands often, and stay home if you are sick.

This is so we can see if the case numbers start to grow again as the state reopens. In Vermont, to achieve that rate, we need to test about 1,000 people per day.\n\nTesting helps us better understand the current rate of active infections of COVID-19 in Vermont, and helps to contain and slow the spread to others.

A pulse oximeter is a small device that clips onto your fingertip to measure your pulse and the oxygen levels in your body.\n\nA Health Department staff member will contact the person who has tested positive for COVID-19 within about 24 hours. They will ask questions about their symptoms and if they have a pulse oximeter at home. If they do not have one, they will receive one within one to two days. They will then be asked to use it to monitor their oxygen levels throughout the day.

          "answer": "\n\nAn antigen test for COVID-19 is a newer type test that identifies people who are currently infected with the COVID-19 virus. According to the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories, antigen tests are only recommended for people who have symptoms of COVID-19. So far, studies on antigen tests have only been done on people with symptoms, and we do not have evidence about the accuracy of the antigen test on people without symptoms. More studies are required before antigen testing can be recommended for people without symptoms of COVID-19. \n\nAntigen tests provide results much more quickly than PCR tests (the most common type of test used to diagnose and confirm COVID-19 infection). When used appropriately to test people with COVID-19 symptoms, antigen tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection than PCR tests. This means that if you have symptoms, you may receive a negative result but still be infected with COVID-19.\n\nAntigen tests may be used to screen people to identify those who need a more definitive test.\n\nWe are monitoring how these antigen tests evolve and how results can best be used. Right now, people who test positive from antigen tests are not considered to have a lab-confirmed case of COVID-19 and are not included in our total number of cases. However, we consider these cases “presumptive positives” and recommend they follow the same guidelines as a positive case to stay home (self-isolate). We also conduct contact tracing and recommend a PCR test to confirm the positive result.\n\nAntigen tests are different from antibody (serologic) tests, which identify people who have previously been infected with the coronavirus and do not show whether a person is currently infected.\n\n**Learn more:**\n\n*   [Coronavirus testing basics](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/coronavirus-testing-basics) from the Food & Drug Administration\n*   [Considerations for Implementation of SARS-CoV-2 Rapid Antigen Testing](https://www.aphl.org/programs/preparedness/Crisis-Management/Documents/APHL-SARSCov2-Antigen-Testing-Considerations.pdf) from the Association of Public Health Laboratories.",

People under quarantine should wear a mask in common spaces. Be sure to disinfect commonly touched surfaces, and check yourself for symptoms for 14 days.",

          "answer": "\n\nA negative test for COVID-19 should NOT be required to return to work. The Health Department does not issue letters for employees to return to work either.\n\nThe best way to know when it’s safe for someone who tested positive for COVID-19 to return to work is to follow guidance based on the presence of symptoms, or the amount of time that has passed since the person was tested. This information is found in the [employer guidance](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-What-employers-should-do-if-their-employee-tests-positive.pdf), under “When can employees with COVID-19 return to work?”",
