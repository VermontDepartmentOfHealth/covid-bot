Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. \n\nAs part of Governor Scott’s [Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase 3](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%2012%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20%20.pdf), people are required to wear cloth face masks or coverings over their nose and mouth when using public transportation—including buses, trains and ride services, and in mass transportation stations or terminals, including airports. Additionally, businesses and non-profit and government organizations may require customers or clients to wear cloth face masks or coverings. \n\nThe advice to wear cloth face masks or coverings is based on data about how COVID-19 can spread before a person has any symptoms. Because people may have COVID-19 but no symptoms, wearing cloth face masks or coverings may help keep people from spreading the virus. \n\nWe all still need to stay at least 6 feet away from people, even when wearing cloth face masks or coverings, practice good hand hygiene and follow the state’s Stay Home, Stay Safe guidance.\n\nThe cloth face mask or covering must be worn properly to be effective and avoid the spread of germs:\n\n* Wash your hands before putting it on.\n\n* Be sure your mouth and nose are covered.\n\n* Hook loops around your ears or tie it snugly.\n\n* Do not touch it or pull it down while in public.\n\n* Keep it on until you get home.\n\n* Remove it without touching your eyes, nose or mouth, then wash your hands immediately.\n\n* Wash it and make sure it’s completely dry before using again. Have a few on hand so you can rotate for washing.\n\nSome people should never wear a cloth face mask or covering, including:\n\n* Children under the age of 2\n\n* Anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious\n\n* Anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance\n\nMedical-grade mask supplies are needed for our health care workers and first responders. Please use cloth face masks or coverings for your yourself and loved ones.\n\n If you feel sick, stay home to rest and avoid going out into public places. If you are sick and plan to see a doctor, you should call the office before your visit. Your doctor can provide guidance on how to avoid spreading illness, such as what steps to take while traveling to their facility and upon arrival.\n\nLearn more about [using cloth face masks or coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).\n\nLearn how to [safely connect with friends and family](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Safely_Connect_with_Friends_and_Family_FINAL.pdf).",

Wear a cloth face mask or covering if you need to leave home for medical care\n\n* **Most people with mild illness can recover at home.** While there is no specific treatment for COVID-19, you should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and take fever-reducing medication if needed.\n\n* **Stay in a specific room in your home and use a separate bathroom**, as much as possible. Stay at least 6 feet away from others in your home at all times and wear a cloth face mask or covering if you are in the same room with them. Don’t share household items.\n\n* **Have someone else care for your pets.** There have been a small number of pets, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the COVID-19 virus, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. If you must care for your pet, wear a cloth face mask or covering, and wash your hands before and after.\n\n**Daily cleaning and washing:**\n\n* **Clean and disinfect surfaces** in your separate room and bathroom. Have someone else clean the other areas of your home.\n\n* **Thoroughly wash household items**, like utensils, after using.\n\n* **Wash your hands often** with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available.\n\nFind out [what to do if you are diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-diagnosed-with-COVID-19_final.pdf).\n\nFor more information, see CDC's guidance on [what to do if you are sick](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/steps-when-sick.html).",

Close contact does not mean being more than 6 feet away in the same indoor environment for a long period of time, walking by, or briefly being in the same room with someone.\n\nA “long period of time” is hard to define because it depends on whether the person was sick at the time and what type of interaction you had with that person. These examples can help you determine whether you were a close contact or not.\n\n**Examples of close contacts:**    \n\n* You live in the same home.    \n\n* You are intimate partners.     \n\n* You rode in the same car while the person was infectious.     \n\n* You had dinner together while the person was infectious.\n\n**Examples of** ***not*** **close contacts:**\n\n* You were their cashier at the grocery store.\n\n* You are a pharmacist who gave the person medication.\n\n* You were in front of the person in line at the store. \n\n* You are a coworker who briefly walked by to ask a question.\n\nA team at the Health Department works with people with COVID-19 to identify their close contacts. This is called contact tracing. The team assesses each close contact for their exposure risk and gives them health guidance and recommendations for self-isolation or other restrictions.\n\nAs the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with\n each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch\n with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe chart describing [what is isolation, quarantine and self-observation](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-chart-observation-isolation-quarantine_final.pdf) has details about what you should do and not do, depending on your exposure risk.\n\nFind out more about [what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf).

Plan to clean these rooms, as needed, when someone is sick.\n\n* **Make sure you have enough groceries and other supplies for 14 days in case you get sick and need to quarantine.** Stock up on only what you will need for 14 days. Do not buy more than you will need so you can leave supplies for other people.\n\n* **Get support from others.** Talk with your neighbors about emergency planning. If your neighborhood has Front Porch Forum, consider joining to connect with neighbors, information and resources. Stay in touch by phone or email with family and friends, especially those who are 65 years and older, who have underlying medical conditions, or who live alone.\n\n* **Take care of the emotional health of your household members.** Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe.\n\n* **Keep a daily list of other people you are in close contact with.** As the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal.

These services range from limited delivery, to curbside pickup and designated shopping hours for vulnerable populations. \n\nAnyone who is sick or thinks they might be sick should stay home. Ask a family member, friend or neighbor to help you get your groceries, or see about having food delivered.\n\nWhen you leave the store, you should wash your hands or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

            "answer": "**Do homemade cloth face masks or coverings work?**\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, it is more important than ever to make wearing cloth face masks or coverings a habit and to bring one with you whenever you leave home. Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. \n\nWearing a homemade cloth face mask or covering can offer some protection to others. This is because people may be infected with COVID-19 and not show symptoms for up to two days (48 hours). The cloth face mask or covering can contain respiratory droplets and prevent them from spreading to others.\n\nWhile health care workers may be able to use homemade cloth face masks or coverings as a last resort, medical-grade masks are considered personal protective equipment. These should be reserved for health care workers. \n\nLearn more about [using cloth face masks or coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).",

We want to know how we can safely connect and stay physically active, especially as the weather gets warmer.\n\nThe best way to lower our risk of getting or spreading COVID-19 is to stay home, but we have reached a point where we can take small steps to restart in-person connections. However, we all have a responsibility to do so thoughtfully. We are flattening the curve, but it won’t take much for cases and serious illness to quickly rocket back up if we are not careful.\n\nOlder adults (age 65 and over), and people with underlying medical conditions, like heart and lung disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe illness. They should continue to stay at home, and family and friends should do everything they can to help keep them safe.\n\nLearn how to [safely connect with friends and family](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/Safely_Connect_with_Friends_and_Family_FINAL.pdf).

Are out-of-state visitors allowed?**\n\nVisitors from other states, and countries, are still being asked not to come to Vermont. If they do, they are required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arriving in Vermont and before engaging in any activities, like grocery shopping or going for walks.\n\nAnyone who leaves Vermont for more than one day for travel that is not “essential\" is required to quarantine at home for 14 days after arriving in Vermont and before engaging in any activities, like grocery shopping or going for walks.\n\nEssential travel is defined as travel required for personal safety; food, beverage or medicine; medical care; care of others; and to perform work, services or functions deemed critical to public health and safety, as well as economic and national security. Read [Addendum 6](https://governor.vermont.gov/sites/scott/files/documents/ADDENDUM%206%20TO%20EXECUTIVE%20ORDER%2001-20.pdf) for more details.\n\nFor those who are in a 14-day quarantine, you may need to rely on neighbors, friends or family living outside of the household to deliver groceries to your home. Check your local grocery store to see if there is an option for home delivery or look for online sources for home delivery. Groceries should always be left at your door. Wash your hands before and after if a signature for receipt is required.\n\nAnyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine has the option to be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctor’s referral.

Vermont’s Medical Reserve Corps units are community-based groups of volunteers who supplement local emergency and public health resources with their existing skills. \n\nSign up with the [Vermont Medical Reserve Corps](https://www.vermont.gov/volunteer) if you:\n\n* Are a licensed and certified health care professional\n\n* Have health, mental health, or other types of clinical or professional experience \n\n* Have health care administrative experience, such as with medical data entry or language translators\n\n* Have worked with displaced individuals, such as homeless shelter programs\n\nVermont has eased licensing requirements for the purposes of aiding this emergency response. Physicians, physician assistants and podiatrists can learn more on the [Board of Medical Practice website](https://www.healthvermont.gov/health-professionals-systems/board-medical-practice/COVID19). Other medical professionals, including nurses and osteopathic physicians, can learn more on the [Office of Professional Regulation's website](https://sos.vermont.gov/opr/about-opr/covid-19-response/).\n\n**Other individuals who have needed skills** (for example, drivers, food service, construction, IT, security, skilled trades, etc.), can sign up at [vermont.gov/volunteer](https://www.vermont.gov/volunteer) and indicate their expertise and availability.\n\nVermonters can also contribute to blood banks, food banks, and other emergency supply efforts. The American Red Cross of Northern New England faces a severe blood shortage and many local food banks and other community organizations are in need of support and donations of supplies. \n\n**Give blood**: Learn how to safely [donate blood with the American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/local/new-hampshire-vermont.html). \n\nSupport your [local Foodbank by donating online](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/) or you can text GIVEHEALTH to 85511. The [Vermont Foodbank can help](https://www.vtfoodbank.org/gethelp) if you need it.\n\nYou can also help your neighbors – older adults (65 years and older) and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions should stay home as much as possible. Go shopping for a neighbor or someone else in need, keep an older neighbor company by phone or at a safe distance. When volunteering please follow the [guidelines on being a good neighbor](https://vem.vermont.gov/neighborly).",

Ongoing reduction in cases for at least 14 days\n\n2. A health care system that is safely able to treat all patients without exceeding its capacity or using crisis standards of care\n\n3. The ability to test all people with symptoms\n\n4. Widespread active monitoring of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and tracing their close contacts\n\nAt this time, Vermont has seen a reduction in cases for at least 14 days. This is hopeful news. To continue on this path, it is critical that Vermonters continue making their day-to-day sacrifices to help save lives. Social distancing (staying at least 6 feet from each other) and wearing cloth face masks or coverings are here to stay for a while, even as we being to reopen, until we have effective antiviral medicines or a vaccine.\n\nRead the latest [Vermont COVID-19 modeling projections](https://dfr.vermont.gov/about-us/covid-19/modeling) from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation.",

For example, an old t-shirt or bandanna and rubber bands or hair ties. Your cloth face mask or covering should include multiple layers of fabric and allow you to be able to breathe easily. Watch a quick [video by the CDC on how to make your own cloth face mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html).\n\nAs the state continues to reopen, it is more important than ever to make wearing cloth face masks or coverings a habit and to bring one with you whenever you leave home. Cloth face masks or coverings need to be worn in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain. For example, visiting a grocery store or on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. \n\nLearn more about [using cloth face masks or coverings to help slow the spread of COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19-VDH-mask-guidance.pdf).",

Can animals carry the virus on their skin or fur?**\n\nAccording to the CDC, at this time, there is no evidence that animals play a large role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19, and no evidence that the COVID-19 virus can spread to people from the skin, fur or hair of pets. Based on the limited information available at this time, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered to be low. A small number of pets have been reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after contact with people with COVID-19.\n\nPets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHowever, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

In other words, it measures the body’s immune response to the virus, but does not detect the virus itself. According to the FDA, in the early days of an infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected. This limits the test’s effectiveness for diagnosing COVID-19 and why it should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose COVID-19.\n\nWith any test, there is always a risk of incorrect test results – false positive and false negative results. We need a good and accurate test we can rely on. The Vermont Department of Health convened a working group of experts to research antibody tests. Their findings conclude that at this time, the serologic (antibody) tests that are currently available are not accurate or reliable enough. Based on these findings, they caution against using serologic testing to make decisions about individuals. For example, using this test to establish “proof of immunity.” However, this type of test could help us better understand the population-level rate of infection from COVID-19 in Vermont.\n\nWe will continue to use public health best practice – considering clinical data, exposure history, and what is happening at the community-level – to make decisions on when to reopen businesses and when to return to work. The working group will continue to meet regularly and will be watching closely for changes and improvements in serologic testing. Recommendations may change based on new data.",

            "answer": "**What is contact tracing?**\n\nContact tracing is a strategy used to determine the source of an infection and how it is spreading. Finding people who are close contacts to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19, and therefore at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, can help prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nA team of callers tries to reach anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. They ask the patient questions about their activities within a certain timeframe – to help identify anyone they had close contact with. (Close contact means being closer than six feet apart for a long time while the person was infectious.) Those contacts might include family members, co-workers or health care providers. **Please note, the Health Department only uses a live person for contact tracing and never uses anything that sounds like a “robo” (computer-generated voice) call.**\n\nThe team then gets in touch with those contacts and provides health guidance on [what to do if you are a close contact of someone who is diagnosed with COVID-19](https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/documents/pdf/COVID-19_What-to-do-if-you-are-a-close-contact-of-someone-with-COVID-19_final.pdf). A close contact is asked to stay home for 14 days and watch for symptoms.\n\nWhile we have been successful in contact tracing, we will continue to add resources and personnel needed to address any increase in the number of people who test positive, which we expect to happen with more testing. This includes the use of technology to help in these efforts. We will be using an app called SARA Alert, a secure monitoring and reporting system for public health that is being used in other states. This system will allow us to offer people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and their close contacts, to enroll in a text-based system to help us keep in touch and monitor their symptoms.\n\nAs the state reopens, Vermonters should consider keeping a contact journal – a list of other people who you have been in close contact with each day. If you do get sick, this would make it easier to get in touch with those people and so they can take proper precautions to prevent further spread of COVID-19. ",

We know that with increased testing we are likely to see a rise in positive cases, and we are prepared to handle such a scenario. A new Testing and Tracing Task Force has been created to guide and oversee this process.\n\nTesting is currently available for:\n\n* Any adult or child with symptoms of COVID-19 – even if their symptoms are mild – who has been referred for testing by their doctor.\n\n* Long-term care facilities and other group living settings:\n\t* All residents and staff in group living settings, where there has been a single positive test. This includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities, prisons, and certain high-density residential buildings.\n\t* If there is a person who has tested positive with COVID-19 at a skilled nursing facility, they can be retested at 3 days, 7 days, 10 days and 14 days after the initial test. This is to help prevent community-wide outbreaks.\n\t*For all sites, regardless of whether a person has tested positive, testing is offered at intake, discharge, and for certain residents who require regular care outside of the facility.\n\n* Staff at correctional facilities\n\n* Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up site without a doctor’s referral, but [registration for testing is required](https://humanresources.vermont.gov/popups). Regular test collection locations still require a doctor’s referral.\n\t* The following groups are encouraged to get tested at these sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone in quarantine for 7 or more days (including people returning to Vermont from other states and countries).
